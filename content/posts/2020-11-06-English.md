## Rich Mind

### Summary 

Knowledge is the key resource of a rich mind.
Once you have the rich mind, it can only get richer.

To improve your mind, you should dedicate uninterrupted hours of learning.
For example, reading books, take courses, listen to audiobooks or podcasts, 
watch interviews or documenttaries, journaling, or share your knowledge.

You must not spend your hours on social network services.
It's a waste of time.

When you enrich your mind, you’re never bored or lonely.
Your mind has a constant thirst for more knowledge.
And that’s what will keep you active forever.
