# Free talk (p.129)

## Unit 1. What are we like?

I asked me all the questions.

| Find someone who... | Notes |
|---|---|
| reads very fast.        | No, I don't. I read a page over and over again. |
| gets impatient easily.   | No, I don't. I think I'm patient unless someone is rude to me. |
| is incredibly organized. | No, I'm not. My desk is disorganized, so I'm not good at organizing. |
| can do math in his or her head quickly. | No, I'm not. I can't do math faster than someone who used to a abacus. |
| thinks it's important to dress properly. | Yes, I do. To dress properly expresses respecting to other people. |
| automatically turns on the TV when he or she gets home. | No, I don't. I turn on the TV when there is a program I want to watch. |
| plays several sports really well. | No, I don't. I do running or surfing only when I really want to do. It's once or twice a week. |
| remembers dates and numbers very easily. | No, I don't. I forget it unless I write it down on a note.|
| likes to do things absolutely perfectly. | No, I don't. I think Mark Zuckerberg's "Done is better than perfect" is true. |
