At today's lesson, I reviewd unit 7,8, and 9, I wish, I wonder, relatives.
And I started Unit 10.
I have homework to make sentences about catching up with my old friend.
In addition, I learned some vocabularies, verval, non-verbal, and creative.

Recently, my teacher haven't given structured lessons, just talking.
So, I have to do something that makes lessons effective.
First, I'll bring up some subjects to make small talk at the beginning of the lesson.
And I'll bring some questions that I can't understand some vocabularies until a lesson.
That is, I'll keep reading news in English and write down my opinion about that.
