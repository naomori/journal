I had English class just now.
Today's class was earlier than usual.
As lockdowns eases, students of English school is coming back.
So, I can't reserve as I want now.

I learned grammar of modal verbs for speculating on today's class.
And I speculated looking at the several pictures.
I've finished Lesson A of Unit 11.

My teacher told me that I ought not to say 'Ummm... Hmmm...' when I'm wondering what I say.
If I'm wondering what I say, I should say 'let me see', 'let's see...', 
'how can I say', 'what's the word', 'what's it called', or something like that.
Otherwise, 'where should I start?', 'How should I put this?',
'What's the best way to put this?', 'How can I explain this?' and so on.

Next lesson, I'm gonna study Lesson B of Unit 11. 

By the way, I didn't sleep well yesterday and the day before yesterday.
So, I can't think well, my brain doesn't work well.
It's most important to get enough sleep.
