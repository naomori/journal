# Today
I worked from home as usual.

Lately, I read a book before going to bed.
Sometimes I'm into the book too much and I don't have enough sleep.
I read a variety of books, but now I'm especially into books which are written by Simon Singh.
He wrote several books about famous mathematicians, physicists, and astronomical scientists.
It sounds like difficult to read, but not like that.
He wrote them orderly and clearly for anyone to read with fascination.
I really enjoy reading his books.
