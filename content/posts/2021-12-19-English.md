# Review 2021/12/10 Conversation - Passive voice

## The example using passive voice
North eastern Japan was hit by huge earthquake and tsunami.
Everybody was shocked at the news that over five thousand people died.
A lot of video that shows many buildings, cars, and people being swallowed by tsunami were uploaded on YouTube.
I can't watch it with being calm actually.

When I come to think of earthquakes, Japan has been hit by earthquakes again and again so far.
I'm sure that Japan will be hit by huge earthquakes in the future.
What we can do is only to prepare for it and remind ourselves of its fear over and over.
