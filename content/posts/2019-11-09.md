Today's lunch was ramen as shown in the photo.
I ate Deluxe Vege Ramen. It had some corns, a boiled eggs flavored with soy sauce and other seasonings, Chinese bamboo shoots, and two slices of roast pork. It was really delicious.
I will visit the ramen restaurant again, definitely.

And then, I and my wife went to Costco at Zama-City.
We bought several bottles of sparking wines, some vegetables,
lots of meats:Sausages, Pork ribs, chicken wings, chicken breast,
minced beef, and shoulder loin beef.
We bought also some commodities and more.
We go to Costco every two months.
I like Costco, especially pork ribs which I can't buy at Japanese supermarket.

In the evening, I went to Murasaki sports at Chigasaki to buy a semi-dry wetsuit.
At first, I'm not going to buy it, just look it.
But I tried it, and it fit me completely.
Using it, I can surf comfortably even in midwinter.
I will try it tomorrow.
