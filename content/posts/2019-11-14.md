My boss suggested to me about my department change.
That is because I've not been fitted this department at all.
My major is Internet and TCP/IP network, and
I'm learning IoT and Machine Learning. Those are almost software.

Therefore, he said that you should be better to work
at other department related with Machine Learning.
Fortunately, the boss of my boss previously lead the center
that contains the department related with Machine Learning.
I responded quickly as possible as I can, "Yes, please".
I didn't want to miss this golden opportunity.

Moreover, I feel that there are several fake engineers in this department.
I hate to work with them. I can't respect them at all.
They are arrogant and pretend to know new techniques,
even though they don't want to study new techniques and improve their skills.
And to make matter worse, they are old and they have powers to decide what to do.
They required me to do their task, so I required them to explain the reasons
that they thought it was important.
They couldn't explain the reasons.
I rejected that and fought them.
I don't want to work with them.

Anyway, now I'm happy to change my department.
