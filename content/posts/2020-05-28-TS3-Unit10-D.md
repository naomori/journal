# Unit-10: What's up?

## Lesson.D: Reviews

### 1. Reading

#### A. Do you ever read reviews before deciding to see a movie? Are the reviews usually accurate? Tell the class.

I've read reviews before deciding to see a movie.
However, The reviews aren't usually accurate for me, they're rather too much praise for the movie.
So, I usually avoid reading any reviews before watching a movie.

#### B. Read the movie review and the comments. What kind of movies is it? Does the review encourage you to see the movie? Why or why not?

It's an action movie, science fiction, fantasy and romance all in one.
Yes, it encourages me to watch the movie, I've watched it before, though.
Because I remember very little about the movie and
in honesty I was disappointed with it due to the simple plot, that is, good guys defeat bad guys.
However, the movie might keep me firmly glued to my seat next time.

#### C. Find the underlined expressions in the review or in the readers' comments. Match them with the definitions. Write a to f.

1. c
2. e
3. f
4. b
5. a
6. d
