At the yesterday's lesson, 
I learned how to use 'I was wondering...' to asking for a favor politely,
and the difference between hope and wish.
You can use wish when you think that it's impossible and
You can use hope when you think that it's possible and it will be happened.

I have a homework.
I have to make five sentences using common expressions which I use 
when I ask my colleagues for a favor.

Moreover, I have to a short speech for news I've read this week, of course.
