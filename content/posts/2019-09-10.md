I worked from home last Friday and yesterday, and I work at the office today,
so I came to the office for the first time in 4 days today.

The reason why I came to the office is to access the server with GPU in my company.
I want to use it to learn Deep Learning.
There is no other reason.

Thus, if I don't use it, I don't have to go to the office.
I can communicate my colleagues via Skype, E-mail or messenger.
Of course, I understand that face to face is important.
But we don't have to go to the office every day.
We only need to meet one or two times a week, I think.
Especially if you spend a lot of time commuting every day.

It's crazy to go to work when the train stops because of a typhoon.
Let's work from home.
