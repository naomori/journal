I couldn't talk well in English at the today's lesson.
I can't find my words and I couldn't use "let me see,..." and so on during thinking.
While I'm thinking about what I should say or what I want to say,
I ought to say something to connect between conversation.
I have no idea about that.

So, I read this below.
* [EIGLOBE English](https://knowledge-plus.com/english/535/)

##### Basic

* Well ...
* So ...
* You know ...
* I mean ...

##### while thinking about answer

* Let me see ...
* Let's see ...
* Good question.
* That's an interesting / a difficult question.

##### when I can't find my words

* How do can I say????
* What's the word?
* What's it called?
* What you may call it.
* I'm not sure how to say it in English ...

##### when I can't explain it well

* (It's) like ...
* (It's) kind of (like) ...
* (It's) sort of (like) ...

##### when I want you to guess what I mean, becuse it's difficult to explain.

* Where should I start?
* How should I put this?
* What's the best way to put this?
* How can I explain this?

##### Conclusion

The above words are called below.

* Stalling Fillers
* Hesitation Devices

You can avoid silence using those words.
You can have time to think about your answer.
You could speak English naturally.
