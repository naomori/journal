Today, I didn't feel good when I woke this morning.
So, I took morning day-off and went to a clinic.
The doctor gave me a medicine for cold.

I wanted to take a day-off today,
but I was going to have to have a meeting with a boss of new department.
The meeting wasn't what I expected.
He just introduced his department.
I expected to talk about my task and its schedule with the boss.
It was not like that at all.

I don't want to be here any more.
I'm disappointed with this company.
The bosses are always late to decide, and there are less engineers.
But I can't complain with them.
Lack of my skill is the reason that I can't do what I want to.
If I have enough skill to change my job easily, I'm not here.

"If you complain, make yourself better."
Yes, I'll do it.
