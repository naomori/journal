Also today, I worked from home.
I did some stretching exercises this morning and yesterday's morning
after waking up.
Then, I can get through the day comfortably.
I'll continue to do stretching after waking up.

I had an English lesson yesterday.
It was a remote lesson via zoom, video call.
I've gotten used to have a remote lesson, I think.
However I'll have a offline lesson if I can.
There is a good point on a offline lesson,
that is I can see a teacher's mouth behavior and hear clear pronunciation.
It's not cheap to have English lessons, even though it's reasonable.

At the last lesson, I gave a presentation about the peak of technology
and I introduced the movie shows the technologies.
Furthermore, I learned about savvy scams and how to prevent them,
and I talked about Japanese traditional cheating, Nezumi-ko.
It's the same as Pyramid scheme.
And "it's me" phone calls.

The vocabularies I've learnt were privately, publicly, scam, cheating, trick,
'when it comes to...', hold onto.
I couldn't explain well why Japanese prime minister
can't have restrict private rights to make Japanese people stay home.
And I couldn't explain well why the COVID-19 has been suppressed in Japan than other countries.
I'll explain next time.
