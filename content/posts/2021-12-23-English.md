# Review 2021/09/15 Advantages and disadvantages

**Keeping the current job vs. changing the job**

It's tough to change your job after the age of forty, I think.
However, you should think of changing your job when you are dissatisfied with it.

The main advantage of changing a job is that you may find your vocation.
You spend most of your time for work, don't you?
If you can enjoy your work, you can enjoy your life.
Secondly, you may get more salary.
Some companies may want your experiences and skills and give you more money.
On the other hand, the main disadvantage of changing a job is that you can get negative stress of changing the environment.
You may not be able to change your job despite of that you spend much time.
Or you may move into worse environment.

Anyway, I recommend you that you should do some action.
You ought to enjoy your life more and you can do it, I believe.
Nobody does't want to be dying gradually, does they?
