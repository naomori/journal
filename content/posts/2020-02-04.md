At the last lesson, I learned to soften comments and make sentences using those phrases.
And I tried to continue speaking for one minute about something theme.

I sometimes couldn't find my words, however, I almost could continue speaking.
It was prepared theme in advance, not free theme, though.
My teacher, Cathay said that I prepared every lessons in advance and it was good,
but I prepared too much, though.
She meant that I only studied a few situations that the book described.
I should imagine various situations and use those vocabularies and phrasal verbs
on the various situations I imagined.
If I do that, I can become able to respond quickly,
because I know the situation or similar situation to those.
Yeah, I know. I don't have enough imagination.
I'll improve my imagination and make many sentences on various situations I imagine from now on.
