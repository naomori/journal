I'm enjoying this 10 days summer vacation.
I'm doing anything same as usual, though.
Because my wife works and I can't anywhere due to corona virus.
I was tidying up my rooms, watching movies, studying something, and going to surfing.
It's same as just usual weekends, nothing special.
But it's OK, I can enjoy it and feel my some skill improving step by step steadily.

Today, I've tidied up my power cables of home network and VPN server setting.
Afterwards, I went to surfing, and came back just now.
It was shorter time than usual, because I could see lightning far sky and it was coming.
I've heard that some surfers was killed by thunder every several years.
I don't wanna be died now yet, so I stopped surfing quicky.

I have 4 days of the rest of summer vacation.
Tomorrow, I'm going to have a duct of my air conditioner fixed.
Because some water drops from the duct during air conditioner working.
In addition, day after tomorrow, I'm going to have my air conditioner cleaned up.
So that there are some mold in my air conditioner.

I feel this rainy season was super longer than usual and this summer is super humid and hot.
Yeah, it must be warmer than before all around the world, I think.
