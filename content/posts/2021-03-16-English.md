## Today

I'm doing good, thanks.
Today, I worked from home as usual.
There was nothing special at work,
but I went surfing this early morning, at six thirty.
Because I thought I should do more exercising.
I've been gaining some weight lately and I'm getting tired easily.
So, I will go surfing every early morning from today.
I will give it up soon probably,
however I will sometimes go surfing early morning.
Because it feels so good and there are few surfers.
And I guess I can concentrate on my work.

34. What winter activity do you like?
    - I like surfing even in winter.
    - I used to go skiing every winter when I was a child.

    - But nowadays I don't go skiing, because it's expensive and I can't often go skiing.
    - Because I'm getting absorbed in surfing.

    - Moreover, I can surf all year even in winter if I wear wetsuits.
    - Therefore, I like surfing the best.
