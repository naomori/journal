76. Explain about the time why you couldnâ€™t express your opinion well.
    - I can't always express my opinion well in English classes.
    - Because I can't still speak English well in spite of studying English everyday.
    - For instance, I can't express well what I felt about something or why I did such a thing, something like that.
    - That is, it's usual not to express my opinion well in English.
77. Would you wait in a long line to buy or eat something?
    - No, I wouldn't usually.
    - Because I don't like waiting for something in a line.
    - For instance, I don't wait in a line to eat ramen or to buy a video game.
    - However, I'm sometimes in a line for eating special local food when I go on a trip.
    - Because I go on a trip to eat local food that can only be eaten there.
78. Advise a new employee assigned to your section what he can do before joining the company.
    - Don't quit preparing for changing a job.
    - If you can change your job freely, you can work here with a lot of fun.
