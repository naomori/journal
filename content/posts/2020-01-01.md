I welcomed the New Year while watching a comedy TV program.
I feel that it's very happy to greet the New Year while laughing.

Unfortunately, we couldn't see the sunrise and Mt.Fuji on New Year's Day because of thick cloud.

Today we ate Zouni as brunch.
My wife cooked Hakata Zouni which is localized in Hakata region.
It contains Mochi, Katsuona(a kind of leaf mustard), Buri(a yellowtail fish), and etc.
It's really tasty, I like it.

After lunch, I went surfing for the first time in 2020.
There were nice waves, I enjoyed totally.
I wish a wonderful year like last year.
