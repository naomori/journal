At the last lesson, I learned about separable phrasal verbs,
and practiced linking consonants and vowels.

I had a English lesson via video call for the first time.
At first, I've got bewildered in unfamiliar remote lesson.
However, several minutes later I got used to getting a remote lesson.

It's sometimes noisy and unclear at a remote lesson,
but it's a good experience for a phone interview to change my job, I think.
I can practice through a remote lesson
to ask interviewers what they're saying and to deliver my opinions to them.
