## What I couldn't say but I wanted to say

### What's the best innovation from Japan?

Kaizen is the best innovation from Japan, I think.
It's a way of thinking for development and manufacturing.
It's a bottom-up method, not a top-down method.
Each employees can make it and contribute to the company and their society.
In my opinion, we always need to improve ourselves or our method of work.
We can lose our job and we can't make ourselves and our family happy unless we keep trying to improve.
Therefore, Kaizen is a good idea and we all need it.
