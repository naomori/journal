# Review 2021/11/11 Conversation (KAT)

I learned compound relative pronouns, like however, whatever, whenever, wherever, whichever and whoever.

1. however = in any way
2. whatever = any thing (unlimited choices)
3. whichever = any one from a limited set
4. whenever = any time
5. wherever = any place
6. whoever = any person

## Utilize compound relative pronouns

Lately, I am not able to have good sleep.
I don't fall asleep immediately, it takes about one hour on the bed until drop off to sleep.
What's more, I sometimes don't sleep until three or four am.
I want whoever to fix this.
I tried whatever ways to sleep well I can think of, like stretching, drinking warm milk, listening to healing music before go to bed.
However, it didn't work.
When I was a kid, I was able to sleep wherever I went and whenever I want ,though.
If you have any idea about that, please tell me.
I will try whichever one you recommend, even if however tough it is.
