Due to COVID-19, every countries' government have started lockdown. 
On the other hand, Japan government hasn't started lockdown.
Why?

The reason is that Japanese constitution don't have the Act,
like Emergency Powers Act in U.K or National Emergency Act in U.S.A.
So, Japan rockdown can't be done.
The Act has power to restrict private rights for moving, shopping, business activities, like that.
It's useful for helping people under severe situations like
terrible earthquakes, hurricanes or disease like this COVID-19.
Why doesn't Japan have the Act?

Because Japanese people couldn't stop starting war 80 years ago,
Japanese couldn't stop out of control of the military and the government.
So, Japanese people are much afraid of that the government has strong power,
and Japanese people haven't allowed the government
to build the constitutions and laws to restrict private rights.
Japanese government can just request people to stay home, not to go out.
