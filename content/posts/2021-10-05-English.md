## Vocabulary and the example
The world population has been increasing
As a result, it is said that food crisis will come in the future.
Raising livestock will be detrimental to food supply.
Because it takes much resources of environment, like water, land, and feed.
I can understand why there is a growing number of vegans who don't eat meat at all.
Not to eat meat is embraced with many people who love animals and nature.
However, can you accept the idea that you will eat anything to get protein?  
I think that many people can't do that.

By the way, eating insects is common at some regions in Japan.
They eat locusts which are boiled down in soy sauce or larvae of bees which are stewed in soy sauce and sugar.
In my case, I can eat as long as it looks nice and tasty, and smells good, even it's an insect.
However, I don't want to see insects in the cooking process.
