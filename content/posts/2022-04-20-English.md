# Today
I'm bit tired.
Because I'm busy to have many meetings this week and yesterday I needed to commute to work to set up a laptop for our project.

What's more, I had an examination last Sunday.
It was so tough that I needed to have four tests and they took total 5 hours, two multiple choice tests and two descriptive tests.
It's difficult to pass the exam as passing rate is about thirteen percent.
I had been studying hard for it and I did my best on the exam, I hope that I will pass it.
They will inform me the result two months later.

Anyway, I'll finish taking an exam for a while.
I'll prepare for a job interview this month and next month.
I'll apply for a new job in June.
