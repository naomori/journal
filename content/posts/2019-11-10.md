This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach.
The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves.
And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit.
It was really comfortable.
I didn't feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty.
I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.

In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.
He had stayed at Hospital for two months due to heal cancer this summer.
Now he got out from hospital and recovered enough.
Next week, we'll hold his birthday party and celebrate his recovery from illness.
My wife worried deeply about his health, but she is relieved now.
Also, I'm happy with his recovery.

I wish that he can walk around as before, so I'll present him shoes.
