At the last lesson, I learned about advising using "if I were you".
And I practiced advising for people who have these worries.

I worked from home today as I did last week.
I'm gonna work from home this week and work at office from next week,
however I will work from home also next week, I guess.
Because Corona virus haven't been calmed down yet.

I'm afraid of world's economic collapse rather than corona virus.
Corona virus kills people, that is certainly true, I think.
But Poor kills people rather than virus.

I wish corona virus will be calmed down soon.
