I learned some vocabularies and grammars about dating.
And I learned some phrasal verbs like get along, go out, break up and so on.

In addition, I learned elope and burn bridge.
"Elope" means to leave from your home to get married
even though your parents don't allow you to do that.
And "burn bridge" means that you can't get back once you've done that.

I tried to speak for one minute about anything, but I couldn't.
I felt high pressure to speak continuously for on minute,
because I don't have enough vocabularies and I can't find my words immediately.

My teacher, Cathy told me that I'd like you to do it next time, so you should prepare for it.
Oh my gosh. OK. I will. I will do it well next time.
Mmm... I will be nervous until next lesson.
