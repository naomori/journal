# 2. My favorite summer memory is

My favorite summer memory is that I rode overhead waves five years ago.

At that time I lived in Fukuoka,
but I used to go to Hyuga,Miyazaki for camping and surfing.

I had been camping in Hyuga that summer, and a typhoon came.
The typhoon passed near my campsite in the middle of the night and left to the east.
In the early morning of the next day, the wind calmed and the big wave remained.

If I wasn't in Hyuga, I could not ride a big wave.
Because I couldn't paddle out to the lineup beyond the big waves.
Hyuga has a very convenient rip current.
I can reach the lineup without a duck dive, thanks to the rip current.

The big wave was so fast that I could hardly catch it.
I thought I wouldn't be able to catch the wave all day,
but I paddled like hell and finally caught the big wave.

I was a little scared at the moment of sliding down from the top of the wave,
but it was amazing beyond words.
I want to taste that moment again.
