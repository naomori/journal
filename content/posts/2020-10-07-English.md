## Today

I worked from home as usual.
It's getting dark earlier.
Now sunrise is at five thirty and sunset is at around five.
By the way, a typhoon is coming.
So, waves are getting bigger. It's good to surf.
Rainy or sunny doesn't matter for suring.
That's the nice thing about surfing.
I don't like jogging under rain.
However, I don't care about rain during surfing.
