Today, we went to Buckingham Palace to see changing of the guard.
I've seen that before on TV. There was crowded so much. 
A lot of tourists came to see that like us.
We saw changing the guard, they were like toy soldiers.

After that, we went to British Museum to see Rosetta Stone.
I was very impressed because it was the key to
solving the mysteries of ancient Egypt.
