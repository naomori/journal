Today, I bought some vegetables at a grocery store of JA, and
I went to a clinic near my home to get a cold medicine.

I'm not feeling well recently.
I have a runny nose and lots of sneeze, and I'm dull.
I think it's probably because of air conditioning during sleep.

However, I can't stop the air conditioner while sleeping.
If I do that, I will get heat stroke.

If I were asked to choose between heat stroke and catching a cold,
I will definitely choose to catch a cold.
Because heat stroke also makes me sleep deprived.

For the above reasons, I went to the clinic to get a cold medicine.
