[Software Burnout Is for Real](https://medium.com/swlh/software-burnout-is-for-real-66092705e2f7)

The author is a software developer,
And he is very tired of working hard everyday.
Working from home or at the office isn't the problem.

Software Is the New Blue Collar, he said.
Coding is a dream job for many.
But around 2050, the software industry will be replete with configurators
who will create a thousand websites and apps from the single designer tool.

ummm.

I don't think like that the author told.
But I believe that the author is so exhausted.
