I was so irritated today.
Yesterday I presented what I've done in these days,
but some my colleagues couldn't understand that.
So I was going to try to explain it in detail today.

It seems to me that they take for granted that
I do research and told them gently what they can't understand.
They think the reason they don't understand is because I don't explain to them, I guess.

However, it's wrong.
The reason they don't understand is because they don't study, it's not my fault.
It's rude to ask someone something you don't understand without trying to understand it yourself.

I want to say "JFGI(Just Fxxing Google It)" to them,
but I don't say it. Because I don't want to be impolite.
If I had to say anything to them, I would say "GIYF(Google Is Your Friend)" to them.
