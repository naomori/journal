Today's lesson was the final English lesson this year.
I started to study English conversation lesson this March,
however, I couldn't feel improving my English skill so much.

I think that I ought to study English everyday.
Everyday. Christmas and New year's days are no exception.
If I really want to learn English conversation and
work abroad or at a japan branch of foreign distribution company,
I must study English everyday.
And I must hope and wish strongly, and do my best at the maximum.
