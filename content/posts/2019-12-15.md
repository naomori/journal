Today's English lesson,
I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event.
I tried that, however, I couldn't do well at all.
I think, it's difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time.
I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English.
So, I can't respond quickly in English about a theme which I've never think about.
I've read books about how to study English before.
Those said, "Think in English! Don't think in Japanese."
I agree with that.
Because if I can think in English, I can respond quickly, I think.
But what should I do? How to study?

So, I think about it.
I'd better build my opinion about anything what I met.
So, I can respond quickly than before.
Because I don't have to translate it.
I don't have to build my opinion and say it in English at the same time.
If I do that, I can improve my vocabularies and experiences with many situations, I think.

I'll try that from now on.
