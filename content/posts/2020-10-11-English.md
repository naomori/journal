## Today

It's a day-off today.
And it's sunny and clody today, not rainy.
It's been raining all this week due to a typhoon.
The typhoon went away without making a landing.
I'm glad there was no damage from the typhoon.

By the way, I got English lessons every day this week.
I wanted to push myself and see how much I could do.
I feel It's tough.
