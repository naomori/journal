I had trouble falling asleep last night.
Because It was hot and humid night.

I heard that the function of the brain is blunted like drunken
if you don't have enough sleep.

That is certainly true.
My head was fuzzy and I couldn't concentrate.

In these day, I'm thinking of buying a bigger bed that is comfortable to sleep.
