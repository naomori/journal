In yesterday English lesson,
I had my teacher check my blog again and reviewed Unit-4, and then finished it.
And I started to learn Unit-5 and found that my teacher eats crisps too much.

I learned the following vocabularies.

* philanthropist
  - I told my teacher about my uncle who is keen on volunteering and then
    my teacher called him a philanthropist.
* divorce and annulment
  - I didn't know the word annulment,
    and so I can't understand the difference between divorce and annulment.
  - She said that in the Philippines divorce can't be permitted for religious reason.
    So they cancel the marriage instead of divorce. It's called annulment.

I recommended my teacher to eat grilled beef with wasabi and soy sauce.
She didn't believe it's delicious, but I recommended it strongly.
