My goal through my life is to be a "master of life".
The word, "master of life", was told in the comic "Master Keaton".

"Master of life" is a person who lives life in his own way and
always has the life of his own colour.

It's my goal, but I have not reached there at all.
But I believe I will be able to become "master of life" someday,
if I can continue studying for a lifetime.
I think it's most important for that to keep studying with curiosity and humility.
