I'll make sentences using vocabularies I've learned at the last lesson,
privately, publicly, scam, cheating, trick, 'when it comes to...', and hold onto.

Outbreak of Corona virus in Japan is less terrible than other countries,
the one of the reasons is that Japanese people don't hug, shake hands, and cheek kiss privately.
In addition, another reason is that
Japanese people wear a mask and don't speak much in the train, buses, and elevators publicly.
That is, when it comes to suppressing outbreak of corona virus, those Japanese custom are useful,
on the other hand, it's too submissive and bad in not emergency situation, though.

I think there are less scam and cheating than other countries, but there is still.
It's almost safe even if you were hanging a bag on your back in the crowded in Japan.
However, you should hold onto your bag in the crowded if you can.

By the way, apropos of Japanese bad habits, it's too submissive and less humor,
aside from Osaka people.
Many Japanese people don't understand joking and tricking.
Especially trick, even if the close friend does it, Japanese people don't like it.
