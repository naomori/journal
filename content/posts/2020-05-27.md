Just like yesterday, I went to surfing after work.
It was windy, so surface of the sea was bumpy and 
it was little difficult to ride waves.

In these days, I've been enjoying knee-riding, which is way to ride on my knees on a surfboard.
It's easy to ride waves and I can enjoy to feel more waves.
However, it isn't a commonly way to ride waves.
I know that.

So, a surfer was approaching me and told me.
"You're a beginner for surfing, aren't you?
 You ought to set your hands near your waist on a surfboard when you take off.
 If you did that, you could stand up on a surfboard."
I said to him, "Thank you for your advice. I'll try that.".

However, I want to just enjoy riding waves, not practice surfing.
Most surfers can't understand that, I know.
They must think that only way to ride waves is to stand up on a surfboard.
In my opinion, it doesn't matter how you ride waves, as long as you enjoy riding waves.

In conclusion, I should probably stand on a surfboard in front of him at least once, 
just to respond to his kindness.
