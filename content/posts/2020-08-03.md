Yesterday, I cooked Takoyaki again.
I actually failed to cook Takoyaki a week ago, however I failed it.
Because I mixed mashed yamaimo yam with Takoyaki dough, so that the dough was sticky. 
I fried it with Takoyaki pan, but it sticked with the pan and was burned.
I was so frustrated with it, so I tried it again yesterday.

I didn't mix mashed Yamaimo yam with Takoyaki dough this time, because I have learned it.
The dough nevertheless sticked with the Takoyaki pan, I was so disappointed with it. 
I have no idea about how to cook Takoyaki well.
I cooked Takoyaki well a half year ago.
At that time, I bought Takoyaki dough at supermarket.
On the other hand, I made Takoyaki dough by myself this time.
It's the reason, I guess.

Next time, I will cook Takoyaki again with Takoyaki dough of the supermarket.
