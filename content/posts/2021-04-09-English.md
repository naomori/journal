# Today

I'm a bit tired.
Because I was a bit busy last week and this week.
Because I had some tasks that needed to be completed by the end of this week.
I finished it successfully.
Moreover, I was preparing for Amazon certified exam last week.
I went for having the exam last Saturday and I passed it.
