# Review 2021/02/07 Lesson

I should remember the flow of a meeting.
Welcoming, introductions, small talk, polite offers and getting started.


## The 1st meeting

* Hi, good morning, Mr.Heras. I'm Naoki, Naoki Morita.
- Nice to see you at last, Naoki, after all those emails.
* Welcome to our company, Mr.Heras. Where are you staying?
- I'm staying at the XXX hotel near YYY station.
* It's the best hotel around here. It sounds good.

## The 2nd meeting

* How are you Mr.Heras? It's good to see you again.
- It's nice to see you again, too, Naoki.
* Allow me introduce Ms.ZZZ a colleague of mine. She'll be sitting in our negotiations.
- Nice to meet you Ms.ZZZ.
+ Likewise. Can I offer you some drinks, Mr.Heras?
- Thank you very much. Can I have a cup of coffee?
+ Sure, I'll have it served for you in a while.
* So, Heras. I heard that your company released the new version of the product you introduced me before. Is is right?
- Yes, that's right. Today, I'll introduce you it.
* Really? I'm looking forward it.

## Notes

"Preparation for Negotiation" is same like "Beginning of the Meeting".
I should remember the flow and speak naturally.
The point is to make a nice atmosphere to talk.
