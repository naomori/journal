Today I worked from home.

At the last time, I learned showing I understand.
And I practiced to respond using 'must' in conversation.

And I'm gonna ask a question below to teacher.
What does it mean? When do you use it?

* gotcha: interjection
    - a word meaning I've got you, used when you catch someone or trick them in some way
    - a word meaning 'I understand'
    - look at possible gotchas when using deep learning in practice, and more.
