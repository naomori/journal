Today I worked from home.

At the last time, I learned showing I understand.
And I practiced to respond using 'must' in conversation.

And I'm gonna ask a question below to teacher.
What does it mean? When do you use it?

* gotcha: interjection
    - a word meaning I've got you, used when you catch someone or trick them in some way
    - a word meaning 'I understand'
    - look at possible gotchas when using deep learning in practice, and more.

The 'gotcha' means got you.
At today's lesson, I learned about how to use 'you see' and 'I see'.
My intonation about 'you see' is weird.
When intonation of "you see" is down, it might be heard that you are sarcastic.
I'll care of the intonation from now on, because I hate a person who is sarcastic.

In addition, I didn't talked well about the thing below.
* I bought fresh fishes online.

I bought fresh fishes online.
Fish farmers are having trouble selling their fish due to the corona virus.
Because most restaurants is closed due to pandemic,
however fish farmers sell most their fishes to those restaurants.
So that they thought about selling their fishes as discount price online.
I bought two flatfish.
It's usually expensive, but cheaper price now.
