I studied reviews for movies and summarized it.
I learned some vocabularies below.
* a string of awards
  - a number of similar things or events coming one after another
  - SYN: series
* stunning
  - extremely attractive or beautiful
  - stands out from the others
* mesmerizeing
  - if you are mesmerize by someone or something,
    you cannot stop watching them or listening to them
    because they are so attractive or have such a powerful effect
* all in all
  - used to show that you are considering every part of a situation
  - SYN: over all, in total

I talked about the news that I've read.
While talking about it, I couldn't say accurately words below.
* activists
  - someone who works hard doing practical things to achieve social or political change
* protest
  - something that you do to show publicly that you think that something is wrong and unfair,
    for example taking part in big public meetings, refusing work, or refusing to buy a company's products.
* demonstrators
  - someone who takes part in a demonstration
* demonstration
  - an event at which a large group of people meet to protest or to support something in public.
  - an act of explaining and showing how to do something or how something works
* supporters
  - someone who supports a particular person, group, or plan

In finally, my teacher gave me some homework.
1. Read some news that I'm interested in and summarize it.
2. Write reviews for something film that I've watched and summarize it.

In addition, I have to tell her those above without reading notes. 
I have to practice summarization and impromptu speech, 
because I'm not good at doing that.
I'm glad to find my bad points.
I can practice it when I find it.

To summarize needs me to have my own opinion about anything.
And impromptu speech needs me to use the PREP framework.
It's been my problem for a long time, I know.
