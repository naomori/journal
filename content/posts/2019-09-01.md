Today is the last day of summer vacation.
It was very hot and humid again today.
I went to JA to by vegetables and
went to a supermarket to buy some foods and drinks in the morning.

I ate Shiroishi-Umen for lunch.
I ate it for the first time and it was delicious.
The noodles are short and easy to eat,
and my wife made the soup for me.
It's so tasty.

I played video games in the afternoon.
I went running in the evening to the Kugenuma beach.
I haven't been feeling well recently,
so it was my first running in a month.
The running really felt good.

I want to run regularly from tomorrow if possible.
