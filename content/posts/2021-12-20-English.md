# Review 2021/09/22 Discourse Markers

So, it's almost the end of the year.
It means Christmas is coming this weekend.
Everybody really cerebrate it on the whole.
Unfortunately, it may be changed due to the omicron variant.

Incidentally, I will go back home during New Year's holidays this time.
Because I will not have so many opportunities to see my parents in good health.
They're getting old year by year, they're not so young to walk freely.

After all, I found that I should take care of people who I love because of this pandemic.
