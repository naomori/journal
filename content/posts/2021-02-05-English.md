## today

Today it's sunny and warm, comfortable day.
So I made a sandwich and a bottle of tea for lunch.
And I went to a beach and had them for lunch.
I was enjoying lunch watching waves, surfers and Mt.Fuji.
At that time, suddenly, a kite, a bird like hawk, took the last bite of my sandwich and fly away.
I was surprised with that.
I knew a few kites were circling above me, aiming my sandwich.
So I was careful about that and I had my sandwich with my hand, like this.
However, while I was distracted in a moment, the kite took my sandwich from me.
