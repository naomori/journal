I learned relative clauses, who, that, and which.
And I made some sentences about my friends using relative clauses.
Moreover, I learned some vocabularies to remember.

* sit across: opposite side
  - She sits across a desk from me at work.
* freak: crazy
  - You aren't a chips freak what you used to be.
  - I'm still a fried freak though.
* meet through: via, because of
  - I have my British friend who I met through my wife.
* been through: have lots experiences of bad things
  - Boxing club mates were people who we've been a through a lot together,
    but now I don't keep in touch them.
  - I have some friends who I've been through a lot together in graduated school.
* grew up with: childhood friends
  - I had some friends I grew up with,
    but now they have left our hometown and I don't know their contacts.
