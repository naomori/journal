The surgery began at 9:00 am.
The surgery was scheduled to end in 6 to 8 hours, but it took 11 hours.
The doctor who mainly operated the surgery told us that
the bleeding didn't stop for a while and he hesitated to continue operating.
Fortunately, the bleeding stopped and he continued.
That is the reason that it took long time.

Moreover, he said that this cancer might have metastasized to the liver.
It'll not become clear until the biopsy is accomplished.

I will there'll be no cancer.
