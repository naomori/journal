## Today

I'm doing good.
I worked from home today as usual.
There was nothing special as usual.
Today is the end of a business year.
So, I was bit busy today.

In Japan, the beginning of the business year is April, not January.
Because new Year's day is the most important holiday in Japan.
Many people go back their hometown to spend the New Year's holiday with their family.
Therefore, the government decided that July was the beginning of the business year for the first time.
However, many Japanese were very busy to prepare their rice fields in July. So, the government decided that April was the beginning.
Because, they thought that the bloom of the cherry blossom and the start working were fit as the beginning of the business year for many Japanese.
As the result, April is the beginning of the business year.
