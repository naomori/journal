# Review 2021/10/30 Conversation - The present perfect with just, yet, already and still

I've just gone surfing.
It has been becoming a routine these days.
Now I live near a beach which I can surf.
That is one of my dream that I have been hoping.
However I've not yet changed into a job that I hope.
I still haven't been working at the place where I can improve myself.
I've already decided to change my job next year.
Therefore, I have been studying English and improving my technical skills through passing several certifications of technical vendors.
I will make it.
