I'm thinking about change of way of thinking about my life. 

* [Japan's formula for life satisfaction](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200510-japans-formula-for-life-satisfaction)

Ikigai means what it’s something you live for.

So far, or even now Japanese traditional companies valued not only company loyalty
but input factors such as time and effort rather than output factors like results or progress.
Long hours and sacrificed leisure time were (and still are) seen as positive virtues,
while the “ganbaru” trait – meaning “trying hard” – is valued above all.
While not limited to salarymen, these attributes soon became an embodiment of the working ideal, dedication included.

But now, some of people started to think that relishing the freedom and opportunities,
multi-faceted approach to a career is key to balancing work and ikigai: “Ikigai shouldn’t be fixed.
If you fix it, you can push yourself too much and lose the passion.
If you have a variety of skills, you can be flexible and continue for longer – that’s my style of ikigai.”
