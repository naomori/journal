# Immigration
I got a little bit nervous at immigration,
because I usually get asked many questions at the immigration examination and
I can't answer well.

This time, however, immigration officers are very kind.
Moreover, my wife said "This is our honeymoon" then,
they said to us "Conguraturations!" with smile.

# Tube
We went to the center of London city by Tube: it's subway in London.
To ride Tube, we bought Oyster card at the station.
Oyster card is a pre-paid card for Tube and London buses and it's convenience.

The London Heathrow airport is in Zone6, and
The hotel we stayed is near the Piccadilly Circus station in Zone1.

We rode to the Piccadilly Circus station by Tube.
It took fifty minutes.

# The Piccadilly Circus station
It was very hard to get out of Tube platform to the ground,
because we had to climb two escalators and two stairs with our heavy suitcases.

# Hotel
The hotel we stayed is next to National Gallery, it was very good location.
We checked in the hotel then,
my wife was tired and had migraines,
so we went to bed soon.
