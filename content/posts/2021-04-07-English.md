## Last week

I'm doing good today.
The weather is fine and warm, it's comfortable today.
I worked from home as usual, and after work I went surfing.

Last week, I was preparing for Amazon certification exam.
I went for having the exam last Saturday and I passed it.
The exam is not difficult, but I'm always a bit nervous for exams.
Because taking the exam is not free and it takes some time to prepare the exam, so I don't want to waste my money and time.
Anyway, I felt relieved to pass it.

At the last weekend, I took a walk looking at cherry blossoms and going to the nearest shrine to pray. I prayed for my family's heath and wealth.
Last week there were some windy days, so cherry blossoms were going to fall.

I like the bloom of cherry blossoms and like also they're falling.
Cherry blossoms are beautiful because they fall.
It means the fragility of the world.

How about your last weekend?
What were you doing?
