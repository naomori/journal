I was thinking of surfing today as I did yesterday.
So I went to surf. But, I couldn't surf, I was almost drown.

The low pressure made strong onshore winds and high waves,
making it difficult for me to surf.
They disturbed me trying to go outside.

The wind was weak early in the morning,
so I wish I had gone surfing at that time.

In the afternoon, I watched a drama broadcasted on NETFLIX.
It's 'Marvel's The Punisher'.
The main actor also play in "The Walking Dead" and "Shot Caller" and
is a very good actor.

I've just started watching the movie, 
so I'm looking forward to continuing.
