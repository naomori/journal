I had a meeting about my new task yesterday.
We talked about my wish, my skills and a new task of a Cloud Development team.
We decided that I join the Cloud Development team temporary.
For a while, I'll work at the team and we'll decide that I join the team officially.

I felt that the boss of the team is nice guy and the team members too,
it's a good team.
But whether I stay here is depends on my task.
If I can enjoy my task,
I'll be stay here until I can find another task about Machine Learning.

I'm gonna continue studying Machine Learning and English to change my job.
And I'm gonna study operating systems and networks.
My backbone is Linux and Internet plus programming.
I'll change my job using those.
