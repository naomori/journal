# Today

I lazed about all day, I just watched movies.
Because it's heavy rainy and windy like a storm today.
I can't go surfing due to the storm.
The waves are too many and junked to surf because of strong wind.

I'm into the movies, Mr.Robot.
The main character is a hacker who has a mental trouble.
He fights his another character inside himself.
Moreover he fights a giant company and China government.
It's so interesting.
Rami Malek plays the main character.
He also played Freddie Mercury of Queen in the Bohemian Rhapsody film.
