Today's homework.
At the last lesson, I couldn't talk smoothly about the community event.
So that It's my homework.

# Who's going to do what?

## 1. When is the event going to be? Where? What time?
We'd better hold the event during summer vacation.
Because adults can take day-off easily.

We might want to hold the event from 5pm to 8pm.
Because children had better sleep early, not staying up late at night.
In addition, adults have got to tidy up.

We ought to hold it at near public park or schoolyard.
We'd rather not pay for venue.

## 2. What theme will the event have?
I'd like to have a dance recital.
Because recently in Japan, all Japanese school have dance classes and dance teams.
So, some dance teams living nearby will participate in the dance recital.
It seems to me that the dance recital can make all community members happy.
Parents or grand-parents would prefer to have great time with their children or grand-children,
and children will want to show the results of their daily practice.

And more, I'd like to end the event with the Bon-Odori dance.
It's Japanese tradition folk dance and
originally a dance to calm the spirits of our ancestors that have come back during Obon.
Now it's just a recreational dance.
Dancers with yukata circle around the center tower, "Yagura" and
dance with the Bon-Odori songs.

## 3. What kinds of attractions or entertainment will you have at the event?
We ought to some street stalls which you can buy drinks and snacks,
and stalls where you can play games.
The stalls make the event lively.
When I was a child, at summer festivals I was looking forward to
barbecued corn, shaved ice, candy coated apple, corn dog and so on.
And I often played ring toss, shooting games, and goldfish scooping.

## 4. How much will it cost to run the event?
It will cost about 3 million yen, I think.
We have to prepare the Yagura, speakers, mics and other things from a rental shop.
It maybe cost 1 million.
And we ought to prepare some tents for reception, headquarters, eating area and first aid.
In addition we need flyers, trash boxes, lights, power generator and so on.
It cost 1 million.
Finally it's stalls. It cost 1 million.

If we don't have much money, we should collect contributions,
and ask builders, carpenters, electricity man, chefs and someone to help us without payment.

## 5. What are you going to do to get ready for the event? Who's going to do what?
First, We ought to build executive committee to operate the event.
And we need to decide the venue at least one month before the event.
And then we should decide each role.
The preparation for the dance event are roughly divided into dance, HQ, and stall management.
Members of each roles do what they have to do.
