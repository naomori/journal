I and my wife went to [Kurumaya](http://kuruma-ya.co.jp/en) in Fujisawa.
Kurumaya had a special service for summer only.
Yukata and japanese cuisine were included in the set,
and the Kimono teacher dressed us in yukata.
In addition, a professional photographer took a picture of us.

The meal was very delicious.
We will definitely be there next year.
