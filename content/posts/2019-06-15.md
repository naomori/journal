Today I came back to my parent's home.
Because my brother who lives in America was going back to my parent's home.
We had happy family reunion on Father's day.

But there was also sad news.
My brother's wife's father had stomach cancer and colon cancer.
He had surgery to remove his cancer, and had been in the hospital for a month.
It was last December.
He didn't inform his daughter that he had surgery so as not to make her worry.
Now, however, he has a good appetite and is very healthy.
He went on a trip last month and enjoyed it.

And there was another sad news.
My mother's brother had lung cancer, which was stage four.
This stage means that the cancer has spread to other organs or parts of body.
I heard that he is being treated with anticancer drugs.
But surprisingly, he's still actively involved in volunteer activities.

I respect them, and I want to have a strong mentality like them that
will not lose to disease.
