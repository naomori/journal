At the last weekend, I went to the dental clinic.
It was the fourth time cleaning. The rest is two times.
In addition, I had my mouth shaped to make a mouthpiece.
Because I sometimes grind my teeth while sleeping.
If I use it, I can prevent teeth grinding.

And I went to Costco, American big supermarket.
I bought a lot, and salted herring roe.
It is often put in New Year dishes.
I love the texture.
It feels like popping small balloons in your mouth, when you eat it.
There are many ways to cook herring roe,
but my most favorite is Matsumae-Zuke.

To cook Matsumae-Zuke,
first, you have to remove the salt from salted herring roe.
You soak the salted herring roe in lightly salted water three times for five hours each.
And then, you remove the thin skin on the herring roe.

And you cut carrots, konbu kelp and dried squid into thin slices.
And you put all ingredients into a mixture of sake, soy sauce and mirin,
and soak them overnight.

In my case,
I buy Matsumae-Zuke cooking set which contains cut ingredients and the sauce,
because it takes a long time to cut those ingredients.
So, I use it and I can cook Matsumae-Zuke really easily.

Tonight, I'm gonna eat it with sake.
I'm really looking forward to.
