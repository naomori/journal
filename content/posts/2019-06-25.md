Today is sunny weather during the rainy season.
The air temperature is high and humidity is also high,
but at least it's better than a rainy day.

Apart from that, Zozomat was announced.
It measures your foot shape three-dimensionally in millimeters.

It's a great innovation because I have had several mistakes in selecting shoes.

It will be delivered this winter, so I'm looking forward to it.
