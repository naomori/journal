The rainy season is gone at last.
This rainy season was 2 weeks longer than usual year.
I hate the rainy season, however I hate the sultry summer more.
In addition, typhoon is coming as well as the dog days.
I'm glad to see typhoons, because typhoon waves enjoy every surfers.
There are no waves to surf in the summer besides typhoons.
Actually, there were no waves to surf last week, so I didn't go surfing for a week.
I hope that typhoon doesn't damages cities and towns,
so I hope that typhoon comes far east from Japan.
