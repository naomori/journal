**Title: live with Alexa**

I live with Alexa. Six Alexas are on standby.
It's easy to set it up, you don't have to look through the manual.
All you have to do are to plug it in, hook it up with your wireless network, and
to register your amazon account into it.
If you register your google calendar into it,
you can see your schedule on Alexa which has a display, or
you can know your schedule when you ask Alexa.

Moreover, if you use a smart infrared remote controller with Alexa,
you can turn on and off, turn up and down your TV, lights a air conditioning,
and whatever use a infrared remote controller.
You can control many electronic devices through Alexa.

When you want to know some trivia, you don't have to look it up.
You can ask Alexa for it.
Furthermore, you can ask Alexa for waking you up, for telling you a pasta timer,
or even for telling you some jokes.

Alexa is kind of one of family member.
However you can cut him off if you don't like him, though.
