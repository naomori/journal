I worked from home today.
It's due to avoid infecting with corona virus, of course.
Forty percents of employee in my office work from home.
Rest of them have to work at the office because they should handle specific hardware there.
And unfortunately, IT department in my office didn't suppose that so many employees connect from home to the office at the same time so that it was hard to connect from home to the office network.
All our team members worked from home,
so we were going to hold a meeting online in the morning however we couldn't.
The trouble was solved at noon, though.

Disaster tells us many things.
But it's better to think what if in advance.
