## Today

I'm doing good.
I worked from home today as usual.
I'm going to organize my room, so I bought a rack and a shelf on Amazon.
Because I want to make my room a better place to work.
As I work from home since this March, I have been making my room a better environment little by little.
I bought a laptop computer and built my computer for work.
In addition, I bought a tablet computer and a display.
I'm going to buy a desk next time.
