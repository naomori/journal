I'm not feeling good very much, today.
Because I had a cold the day before yesterday.
I had lots of coughs and sneezes.
So, yesterday I took a morning day-off and went to a clinic to get a cold medicine.
Now, I've got better, but not perfect.

The reason which I didn't have a whole day-off yesterday was that
I was going to have to have a meeting with a boss of other department related with Machine Learning.
I asked the current boss to transfer me to new post related with Machine Learning.
The meeting was held, however, it wasn't what I expected.
I expected to talk about my task and its schedule, but it wasn't like that at all.
The boss just introduced his department roughly.
Because my current boss asked him to do that, not talking about my task.
I can't understand his thinking at all. It just wastes time.
I am disappointed with him.

At the last lesson, I learned problems and solutions, and I remembered some vocabularies.
For example, do the math. You use "do the math", when you do easy addition or subtraction.
On the other hand, you use "calculate", when you use a numerical expression.
