## Homework
Who is the most beautiful woman in the world?

As I asked for Google about that, it said that Bella Hadid is the most beautiful woman.
I partially agree with that because of her beauty.
However, I doubt that everyone consider her as the most beautiful.
Because I'm familiar with asian faces, so I might vote for one of the Asian in the beauty election.
Probably, Indian will choose one of the Indian and African will elect a person of the African to the top of beauty, I guess.
What's more, we all know that the beautiful personality that they have inside can beautify their appearance and that the person who has foul heart will not be beautiful at all even if the person dress up beautifully, aren't we?
To sum up, beauty is in the eye of the beholder as the saying goes.
Or, you can say "love is blind" if you consider the person who you love as the most beautiful.

# Today
I'm doing good today.
I worked from home as usual.
I was coding software and writing documents all day.
I usually enjoy coding besides debugging.
I always want to improve my skill and get more knowledge that make me accomplish my task quickly and accurately.
