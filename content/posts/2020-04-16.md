At the last lesson, I practiced linking words and learned about giving different opinions
using 'I know what you mean, but', 'Maybe. On the other hand, ','I'm not sure. Don't you think',
and so on.

I worked from home today, but I went to the office yesterday.
Because I took a GPU box back from my workplace to home.
I bought it last month and it was delivered to my workplace last week.
The GPU box can improve computing power for machine learning.
It takes several hours to compute about machine learning on a normal PC,
on the other hand, the GPU box can make it shorter to a few minutes.
It's amazing. Today I set it up for machine learning.
I can studying machine learning comfortably using it.
