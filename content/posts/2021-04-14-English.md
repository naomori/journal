# Today

I'm doing good.

Today, I clocked on at work a hour and half earlier than usual and clocked off earlier. Because there were good waves to surf today, so I went surfing after work. It was a lot of fun.

I'm going to take a day off and go on a short trip day after tomorrow.
I will just be relaxed there without doing anything.
I'm looking forward to it.
