# Review 2021/04/14 lesson - Pronunciation: short a and o

## What I wanted to say but I couldn't

In these days, the number of patients infected with coronavirus is increasing, so the government will decide to declare state of emergency on Friday again.
They want to prevent the number of patients from increasing during Golden week which will be start from next week.

It doesn't matter for me, because I will not go anywhere during Golden week, aside from surfing and shopping at the supermarket.
I will study English and programming during Golden week.
I think that it's a chance to improve my skill.

## Notes
I should be aware of word clarity, thought groups, intonation and work connection. Moreover I should talk more using complex sentences and be creative. Speak well to improve.

# Today

I'm doing good.

Today, I clocked on at work a hour and half earlier than usual and clocked off earlier. Because there were good waves to surf today, so I went surfing after work. It was a lot of fun.

I'm going to take a day off and go on a short trip day after tomorrow.
I will just be relaxed there without doing anything.
I'm looking forward to it.
