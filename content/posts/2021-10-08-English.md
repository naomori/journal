## Vocabulary and the example
The raise of the number of patients of COVID-19 stopped and now decreased enough for restaurants to serve alcohol.
Everybody was refraining from going out for a drink and owner of restaurants tried hard to think out a new method to serve food.
Everyone deserve to enjoy their life now.
Although the sixth wave of COVID-19 must come probably shortly, they should have fun in normal life until then.
They can go on a trip, go out for drink with their friends, or return to their hometown to meet their family.
As they do so, they will be able to relax their minds and face the difficulties that come next.
I'd like to go back to my hometown the next New Year's holiday to see my parents for the first time in two years.
I wish the the next wave will not come until that time.
