#### a book you've been wanting to read?

Even though I haven't read a book in these days, I started to read a book yesterday.
Because the book I reserved a half year ago in a city library was arrived.
The title is "Mastering Civility".
Although I just started reading the book, it will help me in life, I think.
Because I always have one rude friend or colleague, so I want to deal with it well.  
Even if I belong to any companies or any communities in the future,
I might have at least one rude person, I think.

I haven't finished it yet, but it said that
rude words and attitudes effect all people badly.
They make people sick, worse memory, and work inefficiently.
Its effect lasts for a long time.
I think so.
This book must be very useful for my life.

#### a play you've already seen?

Even though I wasn't interested in a play, I really enjoyed "STOMP" at Broadway.
The performance was humorous, exciting, and amazing.
Although I couldn't speak and listen to English, It made me smile and so happy,
because there was no dialogue.
Even if you don't like musical, it must be enjoyable for you. 
If you haven't had a chance to see it yet, I highly recommend it.
