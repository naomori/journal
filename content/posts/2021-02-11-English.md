## Today

It's sunny, warm and comfortable today, so I took a walk and visit a shrine. On the way home, I did some shopping. I lazed around in the morning though.

I usually go to shrine at the beginning of the year, however I haven't gone yet until today.
Because there were a lot of crowed at the shrine at the beginning of the year, and I worried about infecting with the coronavirus.
