# Trial lesson

Thank you for the wonderful English lesson.
I enjoyed it and I could learn what I need to pay attention to,
especially when I couldn't find my words.
That is speaking fillers.
I ought not to say yeah, umm, or uhh like that so many times.

By the way, I began to get English classes of MeRISE coaching,
so I'm looking forward to see you in next your class.
