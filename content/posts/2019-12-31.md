Today I and my wife ate Toshikoshi-soba for lunch.
My wife cooked it for us.
Eating toshikoshi-soba is the traditional custom in Japan.
We Japanese wish healthful long life and eat it on new year's eve.
The long soba noodles symbolize a long life.
The buckwheat plant can survive severe weather during growing period,
so that soba represents strength and resiliency.

After lunch, I went surfing.
There were fine waves and I enjoyed.

Today was the good and relaxing day.
I wish days like today every day through the next year too.
