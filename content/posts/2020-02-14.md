At yesterday's lesson, I talked about my first Sapporo trip.
My teacher has been to Sapporo, but on September.
She envied me for winter Sapporo.
Autumn Sapporo is also good, I think.
However, amazing snowy landscape in Sapporo was amazing and fantastic.

For my homework, I gave some advice to younger people about online dating and something.
Furthermore I talked about getting back in touch with my old friends,
and how I met my best friends.

The day's homework is writing for my best friends in an essay format.
