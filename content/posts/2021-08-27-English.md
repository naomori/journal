## Summary
Italian ice cream company developed a beach umbrella, because they want to make people feel cool at beaches and parks in the hot weather.
The umbrella can produce electricity with its solar panel and make mist to help cool the air underneath it.
In addition, it can be also used for a large ice cream fridge.
Now, it is been testing and, if it works, it can be brought to coasts and beaches in Italy.
