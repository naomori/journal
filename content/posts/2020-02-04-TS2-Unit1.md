# Unit-1: Making friends

## Before I begin...
#### Where do people make friends? 
People make friends at school, neighbors, club, hobbies, workplace, trip, or somewhere, I guess.

#### What questions can you ask a new friend about these topics?
* School or work
  - What are you studying?
  - What do you do?
  - What's your job?
  - Are you a graduated student?
  - Are you a mad scientist?
* Home and family
  - How many siblings do you have?
  - Where do you live?
  - Where are you from?
* Free time
  - What's your hobby?
  - What do you do in weekends?
* Favorite things
  - What's your favorite food and drink?
