[Situational irony: The opposite of what you think - Christopher Warner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqg6RO8c_W0)

## About retirement
I thought that I would retired at sixty and then live comfortably reading books, watching flowers or taking a walk, when I was a kid.
However, now I don't think so.
In more detail, I can't do that to survive for the rest of my life and I need to work until the end of my life.
Japan is facing a declining birth rate and an aging population as well as economic stagnation, so the amount of taxes has been increasing, but wages hasn't been changed.
Ironically, Japanese are living in an age where the young envy the elderly.
