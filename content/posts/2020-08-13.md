Today, I had my air conditioner replaced.
I didn't think about that, I mean,
I've been supposed that I had my air conditioner fixed, not replaced.
Because it sometime had some water drops from its duct.
So, I called to real estate management company of my apartment and 
she said to me that they'll fix it.

Anyway, I appreciated it.
New air conditioner is clean and powerful.
It cools down my room quickly than before.
I feel this summer will be super sultry, and also I work from home.
I can work from home comfortably.
It's lucky for me.
