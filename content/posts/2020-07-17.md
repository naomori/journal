This week, I was trying to train a model which recognize human faces and vehicle registration plates.
However, I have a problem that the it needs more CPU power to train a model.
It's a practical problem.
So I decided to use Google Colaboratory to use more CPU and GPU/TPU to compute faster. 
Although, I have another problem about a storage to hold a dataset for training the model.
The problem is that Google Colaboratory can't have much storage,
therefore I want to use Amazon S3 and tried it, but it's too slow to read.
It takes 3 days to read all images for training, it's too bad.
Now, I decided to use Google drive and I'm copying the dataset from Amazon S3 to Google drive.
Because Google Colaboratory might be able to use Google drive faster than Amazon S3.
I hope so.
