# Review 2021/06/11 Lesson - Conversation

I learned about expression of annoying.

## vocabulary

The biggest one of my pet peeves is to wastes my time.
Because I believe that time means my life.
I'm irritated with standing on a line of restaurants or something,
so I will not stand on a line of anything.
I consider a person or thing who wastes my time disrespects my life.
I will not blame anyone who makes mistakes and uses some of my time.
However I will go berserk when someone do such exasperating things with evil intent.
