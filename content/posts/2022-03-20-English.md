# Review 2022/03/09 Multimedia Listening

## What I couldn't say
I usually go surfing to the nearest beach.
Fortunately, sharks are rarely found there.
And, they are a kind of one that tend not to attack humans.
I've ever watch a professional lady surfer in TV who has lost her right arm.
She has been attacked by a shark when she was about ten year-old.
If I were her, I must have quit surfing.
By the way, my teacher have watched her in a movie, "Soul Surfer".
She recommend the movie to me.
However, the scene where she is bitten by the shark will be too scary for me to watch.
I hesitate to watch it.

# Review 2021/10/27 How to say it better in English
I should avoid contractions when I use English at formal situations.

* Stealing food when you're hungry. should it be a crime?

It seems to me that stealing should be a crime even if you are starving.
Everyone must obey the law, even if it seems unmerciful.
The law helps us to survive in this difficult world.
What if we don't have the law, violence would cover this world.
The law let us have mercy on others, so we can help people who have economic problems by giving food or houses.
Since we live based on the law in the democracy country, we can get freedom to say almost everything I think and to earn living.
I wish that people in Ukraine will be able to get it back soon.
