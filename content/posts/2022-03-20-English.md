# Review 2021/10/27 How to say it better in English
I should avoid contractions when I use English at formal situations.

* Stealing food when you're hungry. should it be a crime?

It seems to me that stealing should be a crime even if you are starving.
Everyone must obey the law, even if it seems unmerciful.
The law helps us to survive in this difficult world.
What if we don't have the law, violence would cover this world.
The law let us have mercy on others, so we can help people who have economic problems by giving food or houses.
Since we live based on the law in the democracy country, we can get freedom to say almost everything I think and to earn living.
I wish that people in Ukraine will be able to get it back soon.
