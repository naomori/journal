# Review 2021/11/12 Touchstone.3 Unit4 (ALEX)

## The example using 'used to' and 'would'.
My mother has three siblings, a elder brother and sister, and a younger brother.
Each her brothers have three children, and her sister has a daughter.
When I was a child, my family always used to visit my grandparents' house the New Year's holiday and Obon, which is like Halloween of Japanese version.
My cousins and I would play climbing a rock that was place in the garden or card games.

Now, most of my cousins got married and have their children.
Those children always play happily when my relatives have a reunion the New Year's holiday and Obon, like my cousins and I used to play before.
I wish that will keep continuing as well as hereafter like so far.
