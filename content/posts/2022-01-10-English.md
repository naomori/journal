# Today
Today is a national holiday, Coming-of-Age day.
In Japan, twenty-year-old people are able to have a voting rights, drink alcohol and smoke.
Some women were wearing in Kimono.
In my case, I didn't participate in the ceremony.
Because I was an university student and had a part time job.

It's like an usual weekend today.
I went to the library to borrow a book that I made a reservation in advance.
And, my wife and I played a board game, "Blokus".
The last few days, we often play it.
