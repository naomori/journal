At the last lesson, I learned about how to use "that would be"
for commenting on a suggestion or a possibility.
And I practiced to ask about imaginary situations and answer the questions.

Furthermore, I learned about 'neat' and "why not?".
You can use "that would be neat", when you listen to someone
who talked you about reasonable and simple idea to solve a problem.
And you can use "why not?"
when you want to ask someone to explain a reason that the person doesn't do something.
And you can use "why not?"
also when you don't have a reason that you shouldn't do something.

I have worked from home for two weeks, it's going to continue until the end of this month.
Because Japanese government asked Japanese companies for letting their employees work from home,
so that all employees in my company are trying to work from home as possible as we can.

Fortunately, to work from home fits for me.
I'm working from home comfortably and use my time efficiently,
because I don't have to commute to the office, so I can take enough sleep.
