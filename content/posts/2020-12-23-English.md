### Example using the phrasal verbs 

Last year the aircraft my wife and I was board lifted off on time and we headed off to my honeymoon.
I sent off some letters and souvenirs to my parents from several places where we visited.
The trip was so good, however we had to clear off several times, because I had planned the trip so busy.
It was so busy trip that I dozed off during the plane and bus rides.
Anyway, I had a lot of fun during the trip, 
because I was able to visit my brother's family live in America and introduce my wife to them.
They saw us off at the airport when I headed off back to Japan.
It was great journey actually.
