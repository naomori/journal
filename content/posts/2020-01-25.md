Yesterday's I worked from home.
I hate commuting, so I was able to be relaxed and work.
I did some tutorials to make AWS Greengrass on Raspberry Pi connect to AWS.
I had some troubles, but I made it.

I had wrist-ache.
I don't the reason, but I have been typed a keyboard too much, I think.
It's painful even if I do nothing.
I hope that it's cured soon.
