Today, I worked at the office.
This week, the progress of my work isn't so good,
because what I tried to end this week didn't end.
The reason is the lack of understanding machine learning.

I wanted to start training my machine learning model this week.
I cannot start it tomorrow probably. Definitely.
It can't be helped. Next week I'll try.

Last weekend typhoon no.19 came, however, I had no damage.
I didn't do anything to prepare the typhoon,
but my wife prepared for the typhoon.
She put things in the room that might be blown away by the strong wind on the balcony,
and filled the bathtub with water.
Because those water can be used for toilet or laundry.

Other areas were severely damaged by the typhoon.
In those areas, the banks collapsed and houses are flooded,
and people were drowned.
It's a terrible damage.
