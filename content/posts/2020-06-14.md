I had a class of English Speaking up just now.
And the teacher suggested me a web site which helps me measure my English skill.
It's ["Test Your Vocab"][].
I did it, and my score is 6,370 words.
It can be enough to make a small talk in ordinary life, however I can't.
Because it's just a number of words I can read, not speak.
I should get more words I can use in having conversations.
And I ought to check my English skill regularly through ["Test Your Vocab"][].
