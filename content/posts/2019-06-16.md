On Father's day, my family ate eel.
I love eels very much.
Eel is just awesome.

Sadly, however, the number of eels has been decreasing.
It's said that the reasons are overfishing and environmental change.

Since the ecology of eels isn't known yet,
complete eel farming is difficult.

Even now, research on complete eel farming is being continued,
and it is said that it may be successful with a little more.

If so, I'm very happy.
