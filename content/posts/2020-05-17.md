It seemed that there was crowded around Enoshima-Island due to tourist.
Everybody can't stand self-quarantine any more, I guess.
So, I avoided going to the beach due to infection with corona virus in the morning and around noon.
I went surfing just before sunset.
It was good saves to surf in the morning rather than around sunset, 
however, there was few surfers rather than morning, so that I could enjoy surfing much.
