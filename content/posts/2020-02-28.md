At the yesterday's lesson, I learned about dilemmas and some verbs + prepositions.
Dilemma means a situation in which it's very difficult to decide what to do,
because all the choices seem equally good or equally bad.
Longman dictionary says that.
I answered questions which have dilemmas.

And today, I worked from home all day.
It's due to avoid infecting with corona virus.
My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.
I agree with that.
Moreover, I'd better work from home hereafter unless I have to work at the office.
I can work from from with less stress rather than working at the office.
Less stress let me work well.
Everybody is happy, I guess.
