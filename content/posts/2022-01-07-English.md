[TIME names Elon Musk 2021 Person of the Year](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2112/211216-elon-musk.html)

## Vocabulary
### Groundbreaking

### Trailblazer
someone who is the first to discover or develop new methods of doing something

### Cutting-edge (of something)
the newest and most exciting stage in the development of something

### Visionary
1. having clear ideas of what the world should be like in the future

## The example using the vocabulary I learned
I've never done a groundbreaking work, never been a trailblazer, never developed the cutting-edge of something, and never been a visionary.
However, I will name me as a person of the year 2021.
Because I studied hard last year to get several certifications about information technology and to improve English skill and I got better score I've never had.
I tried to change my job and got an offer, but I decided not to change it.
Because I felt I'm able to improve myself more and get better position.
This year, I will keep studying hard and will change my job at last.
