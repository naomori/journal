I worked from home today, as usual.
I went to surfing yesterday and the day before yesterday.
I tried bodyboard at that time.
This week, there was strong wind and high waves.
so that it's tough to surf using middle length surfboard, I thought.
So, I used a bodyboard and wore swim fins.
Because it's easier to move by kicking with swim fins than hand paddle.
When there is high waves, I have to dive under waves
but it's tough to use middle length board.
I can't sink the board because it has very buoyancy.
On the other hand, a bodyboard doesn't have much buoyancy,
so I can sink it and move fast by swim fins.
I enjoyed bodyboarding.
