At last, I decided to build my desktop computer.
The latest desktop computer has fast and multicore CPU, huge and fast storage, a liquid cooler and GPU.
It's super expensive, about 400,000-500,000 yen.
On the other hand, when you build them yourself, it's cheeper to build them than buy it.
So, I'm decided to build them.
Because I'm unsatisfied with the performance of my laptop.
Since I work from home, I've been using my laptop for handling with huge data, such as images.
However, the calculating requires much computing resources.
It takes tremendous time to cleanse huge data and training a model using machine learning.
It takes two or three days. No way.
I can't wait until it's finished.
A new computer which I'm gonna build will be able to finish it quick.
I'm looking forward to it.
