It's snowy today, so I carried my wife to her workplace.
I'm gonna study English and Kubernetes today.

At the yesterday's lesson, I discussed the questions. 
And I leaned the vocabularies below.

* carrier, asymptomatic
  - I don't want to be a corona virus career.
  - Because I don't want to kill anyone.
  - Even if I became a corona virus career, I might be an asymptomatic.
  - However, if I carried corona virus to old guys, they might be died.
  - So, I'm trying to avoid infection with corona virus as much as possible.
* addicted
  - I was addicted to chips before.
  - It's too unhealthy, however I couldn't stop.
  - Once I started eating chips, I couldn't quit until eat all of it.
  - I could stop the bad habit, however recently I ate chips much.
  - Because I was eating chips whilst working from home.
  - It's bad thing, I know.
  - So I should stop again not to have it a habit.
* depress, depression
  - I wanna go to Cebu for learning English, but I'm not sure that I can go.
  - I wanna improve my English kill as faster as possible, though.
  - If I couldn't go to Cebu, I would be depressed.
  - However, I'm trying to improve English skill so that I'm wanna get additional online classes.
