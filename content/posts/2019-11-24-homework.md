# At the last lesson
At the last lesson, I learned snack habits
and how to use words giving examples such as like/for-example/such-as.
And I talked about Japanese traditional soup dish,
and I remembered Binignit, Filipino dessert soup like Zenzai.

# the difference between mochi and dango

The difference is the shape of rice which is the ingredient of those.
Mochi is make from rice, on the other hand,
Dango is make from rice flour.

Some Japanese sweets include the name "mochi" in their names,
but they are not always make from mochi rice.
