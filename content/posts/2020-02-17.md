At today's lesson, I talked about one of my best friends,
how we met, where we became friends and his characteristics using "both" and "neither".
Finally, I reviewed this unit through vocabulary notebook, phrasal verbs.

Next lesson, I'm going to make some sentences using phrasal verbs,
and then I'll start unit 8.
So that I have to review those phrasal verbs.
My teacher said that you will use phrasal verbs in usual conversation
and so it's useful and you should learn phrasal verbs definitely.
I agree with that totally.
