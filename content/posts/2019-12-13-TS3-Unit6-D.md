# Touchstone-3 Unit-6: Managing life
## Lesson D: Less is more

### 1. Reading

#### A. Do you ever multitask? What kinds of things do you do at the same time? Is multitasking a good thing to do?

About 20 years ago, when I was at network operation team in the previous company,
I sometimes did multitask.

When I was in a network trouble, I've done multitask.
It was calling customer, solving the problems, writing the report,
asking my colleague to help me by a chat tool,
and explaining that to my boss at the same time.

Multitasking isn't a good thing, I think.
But rarely, I've got to do that.
You'd better not do multitask.
