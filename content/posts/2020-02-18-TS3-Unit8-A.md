# Unit-8: What if?
## Lesson.A: Wishes

### 1. Getting started

#### A. What would you like more of in your life?

I can't speak English smoothly and naturally.
So I wish I could speak English well.
If I could speak English well, I could enjoy movies, musical, and trip more than before, definitely.
Furthermore, if I do that, I'd get a interesting job and work happily.
And if I win a lottery,
I'd probably take long vacations to go all around the world.

#### B. Listen to the people above talk about their wishes. What do they want?
1. She wants enough time to go kayaking every weekend.
2. They want to live in a bigger place.
3. He wants enough money to go to Egypt to see the pyramids.
4. She wants to live closer from her family to be able to help out.

#### C. Answer the questions.
1. No, he doesn't. He doesn't have enough money to go way on holidays.
2. Yes, she is busy now. She's too busy to do anything fun.
3. No, she doesn't. She lives far away from her family. 
4. Their place is a tiny little apartment. It doesn't have enough room for all their stuff.
