Before starting Lesson C.
I will do homework about Lesson B.

# Unit-7: Relationships
## Lesson.B, Section.2 A.7-9

#### 7. First dates usually turn out to be a disaster!
I agree with that partially.
Not usually, sometimes it turns out to be a disaster.
Because someone who don't know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date.
The person don't know what the another person like and don't like,
so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don't like.
If the person do that, it can turn out to be a disaster.
Some people, however, do well at the first date.
They can agree very well together.

In my case, the first date usually turns out not to be a disaster,
but not to be a great success, it's a bit success or a bit failure.

A bit success is good for me, I think.
It means that I have more occasions to know the person
and let the person know about me at the next date.

In case of a bit failure at the first date,
I don't call to the person, and the person don't call either.
We don't contact each other.
It's a peaceful breaking up.

#### 8. Relationships never work out when one person has to move away.
I almost agree with that.
Time you spend with someone make your relationships improve.
So that the relationships usually don't work out if one person has moved away.
But in these days you can use video calls using kind of Facetime and Skype.
Therefore, even if one person has moved away, you can keep the relationships maybe.

I think relationships sometimes work out even if one person has to move away.
But, I don't know the person around me who do well long-distance relationships.

#### 9. When a close friend sends you an email, you should write back immediately.
I agree with that totally.
To work out the relationship,
it's important to express your respect or friendship to your friends.
If you don't write back immediately,
your friend may feel that you aren't a close friend.
It means you lost your friends' trust.
So that you ought to write back as soon as possible..
To keep relationships, you'd better care about your friends.
