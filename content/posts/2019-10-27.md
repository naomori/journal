Today, I woke up at noon and ate fried rice with eggs and takana for lunch.
Takana is make from pickled mustard leaf.
It's crunchy and spicy, I like it.

In the afternoon, I went surfing.
There was small waves, but it's high enough to enjoy surfing.

In the evening, I went to Tokyo to participate in a study session for Deep Learning.
I'm working on image analysis using deep learning at work,
but I'm in trouble because I don't have any colleagues who are skilled in deep learning.
So, I sometimes attend such study sessions and ask questions to experts.
