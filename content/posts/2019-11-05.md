Today, I asked my wife to take my bicycle to a cycling shop and have my bicycle attached a basket.
My bicycle is an electric bicycle and it has a battery.
Yesterday I removed the battery to charge electric power and forget to attach it back.
When my wife was busy to prepare her work in this morning, she found that.
So she was angry with me about that and she's in a bad mood.
I'm really sorry for that, but I don't think she should get angry so much.
I feel heavy that her mood could be bad when I get home.
