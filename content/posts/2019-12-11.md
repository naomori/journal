I had a meeting with my boss and the boss of my boss.
The boss recommended me,
"You'd better find the department which you can do what you want to."
"Because in this department, there isn't sections where you want to work, I think."
And he told me,
"You can try to work at Cloud development section for a while."
"While you're working at the section,"
"you're going to have to make up your mind,"
"if you transfer to another department or stay here."

I responded to him that I'll try to work there and find another department.
I suppose that I'll apply to new task in another department next January.
I can't fit this department, and I don't want to stay here any more.
