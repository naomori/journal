At the last lesson, I practiced Unit.6 Free talk again.
And I read the blog and summarized it.

At the previous lesson, I couldn't keep discussing about a community event.
This time I did. I was relieved to be able to do that.
I was a bit nervous before the last lesson.
But I did and I got a bit confidence about English conversation.
