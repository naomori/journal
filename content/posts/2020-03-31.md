I'm so sorry for his death.
He is the greatest and most loved comedian in Japan.
I used to watch his comedy show every Saturday when I was a child.
I think half of Japanese people watched his show at that time,
especially kids including me loved him.
I genuinely pray that his soul may rest in peace.

His death will save many Japanese, I guess.
So far, many Japanese might think "I'm OK. I won't be infected with corona virus".
But it definitely wasn't true.
You may be OK, but you might kill someone who has some healthy problems.
One of his friends might have possibly infected him with corona virus.
Possibly next you do. You might kill your friends or family.
Many Japanese think so now, I think.
