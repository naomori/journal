[The Internet Needs a New Architecture that Puts Users First](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-the-internet-needs-a-new-architecture-that-puts-users-first/)

The article said that treating the internet like a public utility only bolsters the platform giants.
A more secure model starts with control by the people.

We rely on the internet more and more for work, social connections, and basic needs.
However, a few companies in Silicon Valley occupy the Internet and
people's personal data is less secure than before.

So, it said that we should have localized internet that isn't influenced by big companies. 

That's it.

Actually I can't understand what the author want to say.
But I can understand that the author is worrying about Internet security and
concentration of the information and wealth.

I think the block chain technique can enable what the author wants.
