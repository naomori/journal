I use a textbook ["TOUCHSTONE 2nd edition Student's Book Level 3"][touchstone] in my English lesson.
It's at the low intermediate CFER level ([A2][]-[B1][]).

The followings are the homework I have to do by tomorrow.

# page.5: Lesson-B 3.C

#### Who do you admire ? 
I admire my brother.

#### Why ?
Because, he works as a engineer in America.
I also want to work as a engineer in America or Europe.
I envy him working abroad and I'm proud of him.

#### What do you have in common ?
Both he and I tend to get carried away with oneself.
For example, when the high school baseball team we graduated from took second place at the Koshien,
we were so much excited that we made merry and drank too much.

#### How are you different ?
I am introverted but he is cheerful and extroverted,
so he has many friends.

# page.6: Lesson-C 1.A

Which two habits do you think are most annoying in a co-worker or classmate ?

As for me, "Disturbs people" and "wastes time" are most annoying habits.

#### Smiles all the time
A person who smiles all the time is uncomfortable for me.
I have no idea what he is thinking about.
Maybe he hides his real thoughts to cheat people.

My old boss had smiled all the time.
It was disgusting to me.

#### Criticizes others
A person who criticizes others gives no constructive opinion.
It's just noisy and useless.

#### Stands around and talks
It doesn't matter to me,
if it's necessary to do so and if he doesn't talk to me.
I'll just plug my ear.

#### Disturbs people, wastes time
I hate these habits.

Being Disturbed when I'm concentrating,
it takes time to concentrate again.

I hate the most that someone wastes my time.
I feel he wastes my life and insults me.

#### Talks about people behind their backs
A person who talks about people behind their backs is chicken and stupid.
He has no courage to protest against someone and
he is too stupid to protest logically.
