## How am I donig today?

I'm doing good.
Last Saturday, I had my hair cut.
I feel my head became lighter than before.
And it's good for surfing.

Did I mention my plan to go on a trip to Okinawa before?
I'm decided to go on a trip to Okinawa next January.
My wife's birthday is in January.
The reason I decided to go on the trip is because I'm little bored of staying home and 
I want to go somewhere with Japanese government support.
Japanese government discounts travel fee to help boost economy.  
Japanese government pay for a part of travel fee from tax, that is to say, I paid for it.
Therefore, I don't want to lose money by not traveling.
