### The body of the presentation

<!-- the 1st part -->
I'd like to start by looking at the history of Ise-city.
As you may know, there is Jingu in Ise city. Jingu includes 125 shinto shrines, centered around Naiku, dedicated to Amaterasu-Omikami. Amaterasu-Omikami is the goddess of the sun, the most important goddess of the Shinto religion in Japanese mythology. Amaterasu-Omikami's chief place of worship, Jingu in Ise-city, is one of the Shinto's holiest sites.
Therefore, Japanese emperor and prime minister worship at Jingu at the beginning of every year.
Well, I've told you about a brief of history of Ise-city.

<!-- the 2nd part -->
Now we'll move on to the reason that there is a variety of Mochi desserts in Ise-city.
As I mentioned before, Ise-city is the most important place of Shinto religion. Moreover Ise-city is a major pilgrimage center and tourist spot. About ten million people visit Ise-city for worship every year.
The pilgrimage to Ise became very popular in the Edo period, about 400 years ago. In those days, people used to walk to Jingu to worship. It is said that those people from all over Japan who came to Ise-city preferred to eat Mochi on the way, as it is fast and filling. Therefore, many tea-houses along the Jingu pilgrimage road greeted worshippers with Mochi.
That is why there is a lot of kinds of Mochi desserts in Ise-city.

<!-- the 3rd part -->
Next, I'd like to introduce you a variety of Mochi desserts and recommend you my favorite.
Please see these pictures. As you can see, there are a lot of Mochi desserts in Ise, those are only a part of the whole though. All of them are different and delicious, but I recommend you Akafuku.
If you ask me, Akafuku is the most famous and the most delicious Mochi dessert in Japan. There are a number of great things about Akafuku. First of all, the bean paste is very smooth and pleasant to the tongue. Then Mochi is exquisitely soft. Next you can enjoy Akafuku-Gori, which is a Matcha-flavored shaved ice with Akafuku, in summer. In winter, you can enjoy Akafuku-Zenzai, which is the sweet porridge of red beans with grilled Mochi. Finally, you have to go to Ise to eat Akafuku, because they are strict about quality management of Akafuku and only sell it in Ise.

### End of the presentation
To sum up, I introduced you the history of Ise-city and the reason that Ise has a variety of Mochi desserts. Finally I recommend you Akafuku.

In conclusion, you ought to go to Ise and eat Akafuku, when you come to Japan. There are many places to visit in Japan. For example, Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, and so on. Those are amazing places actually.
However, I would recommend you Ise, my hometown. Ise has Jingu, one of the most holiest shrine, and a variety of Mochi desserts.
If you want to know the soul of Japan and if you are foodie, why don't you come to Ise?

That brings me to the end of my presentation.
Thank you for listening so attentively.
I would be glad to answer any questions now.
