* M: You said that the price per unit would be 500 dollars.
  - Is there any way you can offer discount on ~~the~~ **that** amount?
* W: You are only ordering 20 units.
  - We can't really offer **a** discount on such a small-scale order.

* M: Suppose we ~~'ll~~ place **a** larger order, say ~~it's~~ **for** 50 units.
* W: In that case, we ~~can~~ **could** take 5 percent off.

* M: After allowing for insurance and distribution cost**s**, not to mention technical expenses,
  - I don't think our sales staff would be able to make a profit.
* W: Can I make a suggestion?
  - You're interest**ed** in the K-12 model.
  - We've just come out with ~~the~~ **a** new K-16 model.
  - It has almost all the same features as the K-12 except the lens is slightly smaller.

* M: What's the unit price of the K-16?
* W: That's the good news.
  - The K-16 is only 350 dollars per unit.
  - Plus it comes **in a** wider range of colors than **the** K-12.

* M: That might be suitable.
  - And it ~~would~~ **should** satisfy ~~with~~ our directors.
  - Can you send me a sample unit?
* W:
  - Sure.
  - You've been a steady customer for years.
  - We'll ship ~~on~~ **one** to you right away.
