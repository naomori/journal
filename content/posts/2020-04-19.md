In the morning, I went surfing for the first time in a while.
Because I bought a bodyboard and wanted to try it.
Fortunately, there were good waves to surf.
Unfortunately, I lost my right foot swim-fin.
When I tried to ride a big wave and I caught it,
however, on the contrary the wave caught me and swallowed me.
I was swallowed, upside down, round and round.
When I floated to the surface of the sea,
I realized that my right swim-fin had gone.
I should have put on a swim-fin with a leash code.
Next time I will hook it up with my swim-fin.

In the afternoon, I went to book-off for selling my unnecessary items,
a PlayStaion 4, wireless router, a display and old surfboards.
Recently I haven't played with PlayStation, I bought new wireless router and a bodyboard.
I'm tiding up my room, so I want to sell somethings I don't use.

And the, I went surfing for the seconds time today.
This time I used middle length board.
Waves were smaller than morning one,
but it's good to enjoy surfing with middle length board.

Today was a fulfilling day.
