[Flying Taxis](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2202/220217-flying-taxis.html)

## Summary
Science fiction is now becoming true, it's airborne taxis.
The Japanese airline and a U.S. tech start-up are working together on building it.
They are also work out for building traffic rules and training flying taxi pilots.
They say that the taxis would be good for the environment as well as travelling with avoiding congested places.

## Takeaway
That's amazing, I think.
The Tokyo metropolitan area has always a traffic jam problem.
Because many people have been moved to cities for work.
On the other hand, a lot of local governments aren't able to serve people enough due to a lack of population.
That means that they have enough money to maintain roads or bridges.
The airborne taxis that don't require roads and bridges could help them as well as people in cities.
Therefore, the flying taxies could help so many societies.
