Today, I had my teeth deep cleaned at a dental clinic near my house.
It was for the first time in 5 or 6 years,
because it's little bit painful and a bother.
I don't like anesthetic injections into the gums.
It doesn't hurt so much because the surface anesthesia is done first.
However, I don't like teeth cleaning because it spends time.
Normally it spends 4 weeks or 6 weeks.
I hope that it's finished in this year.
