At the yesterday's lesson, I practiced delivering my experience and making a question.
I couldn't respond quickly, and I took time to deliver my experience.
It was difficult to organize thoughts first before delivering.
I felt I had to respond quickly, on the contrary I couldn't find my words.
Or I found only meaning less words.

Calm down, chill out, take it easy, Naoki.
Nobody blame you. You don't have to feel nervous.
You can calm the mind, organize your thoughts and state your opinion.

OK. I'll try. I can do it next time.
