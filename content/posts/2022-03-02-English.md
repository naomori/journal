# Review 2021/09/30 Expressing preferences

I really love surfing and camping now.
I liked hanging out in bars with my friends before, though.

I'm very interested in programming and the Internet now.
I found those so exciting that those technique can change our lives.

I don't enjoy visiting crowded spaces, like a party, a dance hall, and so on.
In addition, I hate standing on a line.
I don't understand that some people stand on a line to eat a pancake.
I found standing on a line wasted time of life.
