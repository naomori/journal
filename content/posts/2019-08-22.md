Today, I went to Osaka to get a lecture of AI.

I always buy the following this.

It's the most famous steamed bun with meat filling in Japan, especially in Kansai region.
I stayed in the line for about twenty minutes to buy it.


And then, I ate the following this because I had enough time before the departure of the Shinkansen.

It's also famous ramen in Kansai region.
The last time I ate it was when I was a graduate student, about 15 years ago.
It was several times more delicious than that in my memory.
I want to eat it again.
