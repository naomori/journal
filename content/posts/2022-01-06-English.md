# Today
It's snowing today.
It's cold as only two degrees.
There is snow on the ground for the first time this winter.

Are you and your family safe now?
I heard that the last typhoon gave serious damage to Philippines.
I hope for the speedy recovery and the early restoration.
I wish you and your family, peace and good health.

I'm still on vacation until next Monday.
I have been lazy this vacation, like watching movies, reading books, surfing, and so on.
However, I didn't go on a trip as I concern Omicron variant.
The number of patients begins increasing the last few days.
