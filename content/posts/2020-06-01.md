Rainy season is coming. It comes 3 week earlier than usual year.
Also mosquitoes is coming. I hate both.
I can't sleep at all hot and humid night with flying mosquitoes near my ears.
It's too irritating to keep sane.

So, I bought an insect repellant and insect killer at Costco in Zama city.
Zama is little bit closer than Yokohama from Fujisawa.
There was fewer people than usual at Costco.
Maybe people care about crowded place.
However there is less goods than usual.
I can't buy olive oil, chicken breast tender, and so on.
I don't know why. Maybe many shoppers came there in the morning.
I went to there at 3 pm.

I worked from home in the usual way today.
It's happy to live in the usual way.
