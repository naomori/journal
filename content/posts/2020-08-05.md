I went to sufing for the first time in a week.
There were not enough waves to surf since last week.
However, I was frustrated without surfing.
So, I went to surfing this late afternoon, there still were not waves, though.
It refreshed me and released my frustration.
After all, I love surfing.
I wish enough waves to surf every day.
