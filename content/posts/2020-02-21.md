I worked at home, today and last Wednesday.
Because Corona virus is out-breaking now in Japan,
so that I avoid crowed places as possible as I can.

Some people says it's too much to worry about.
Yeah, I know.
But, my wife is weak, so it will be a problem if she is infected with corona virus.
Because corona virus kills people who have a health problem.

I wish that corona virus doesn't spread any more.
