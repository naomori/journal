Today I worked from home as usual.
Nothing special.

Last weekend, I went to surfing and I enjoyed it.
Because typhoon swell arrived at the beach and there are many good waves to surf.
However, typhoon has gone, also waves have gone. 
It left just strong wind. Strong wind is bad for surfin.
Because it disturbs waves, the sea surface is bumpy and it doesn't fit for surfing.
