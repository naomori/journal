## Review 10/27 lesson

I should use positive words in a job interview.
Moreover, I'd better tell my experience and achievement.

### a. Answering questions about your weakness

My weakness is that I'm eager to use new technology or method I've never done.
Because I want to solve a problem while improving my skill.
On the other hand, to solve a problem don't always require new technology and method.
Therefore, at first I make a plan to solve a problem and have my colleagues review it.
As a result, I can opt for better choice to solve the problem and 
also find a way to improve my skill while solving it.

### b. Answering questions about your status 5 years from this point

### c. Answering questions about your conduct under pressure

### d. Providing your intention of joining the company you are applying for

### e. Answering a question about conflict

## Today

I'm decided to go a trip to Hokuriku region in the end of the year.
Hokuriku region is north west from here and it's snowy region.
Hokuriku region has delicious seafood in winter.
For instance, crab, yellowtail fish, black scraper fish, deep-water shrimp, and deep-sea fish.

In addition, probably it will snow heavily this year as usual.
I'm looking forward to beautiful snowy scenery.
