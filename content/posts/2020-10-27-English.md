## Today

I'm decided to go a trip to Hokuriku region in the end of the year.
Hokuriku region is north west from here and it's snowy region.
Hokuriku region has delicious seafood in winter.
For instance, crab, yellowtail fish, black scraper fish, deep-water shrimp, and deep-sea fish.

In addition, probably it will snow heavily this year as usual.
I'm looking forward to beautiful snowy scenery.

57. How do you prepare for travelling for work?
    - Firstly, I confirm the schedule of the meeting or the process in the destination.
    - Secondly, I reserve tickets for airplane or train, and hotels.
    - Thirdly, I look up the timetable of public transportation from or to the airport/station.
    - Finally, I prepare a backup plan in case I need to stay there more.
