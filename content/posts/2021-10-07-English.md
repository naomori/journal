# Review 2021/10/07 Touchstone3 (ALEX)

To be a supportive listener, you should use short responses,
like really or sure to agree and to be that.

Don't you think that online movie services, which are Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and so on, has a large selection of movies lately?

I subscribe to Amazon Prime Video, because I often use Amazon delivery service.
It's excellent, but there are so many movies that I can't watch all that I want to, aren't they?

I'm keen on Life below zero, which is one of movies of Amazon Prime Video, that describes people who lives around the Arctic Circle.
Can you imagine that you live there?

What if I had to live there, I would be scared of bears, coldness, and especially frost bite.
I don't want to lose my fingers.
I'm a software engineer and I need my fingers to type a keyboard for programming and making documents.
If I lost my fingers, I will lose my job.

If you can choose the place where you live, where would you choose besides Philippines?

# Today
I'm doing good today.
I worked from home as usual.
There was nothing special, unfortunately.
Now, the number of patients of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly fortunately.
That's because about 60 percent of population in Japan have already got vaccinated, I think.
A month ago, it's difficult to get dose of vaccine.
However, you can get it immediately.
It's sound nice.
