I had my teeth clean at dental clinic in the morning.
I have been going to dental clinic to remove dental stone from my teeth every 2 or 3 months.
Because teeth care and eye care are most important factors for quality of life.
I want to trip all over the world and enjoy local speciality meals there,
I want to see beautiful views and historical spot.

Moreover, physical fitness is also important.
So, I went surfing for the first time in a while.
It was rainy and little bit strong wind,
however surfing was super fun and exciting as I expected.

I hope that everyone can enjoy surfing without worrying about COVID-19 soon.
