[Self-Introduction Tips and Tricks(with Examples)](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/self-introduction-tips)

# 1. Summarize your professional standing

My name is Naoki Morita.
I have a master's degree in information science, and 
I've been working as a software engineer, especially related to network, for about 20 years.
I work for hoge corporation, it's an electric industrial company.

# 2. Elaborate on your experiences and achievements

I've started learning English in March of the last year in this school.
Because I had visited in England, America and Canada for vacation last year,
and then I thought I could have enjoyed it more if I could speak English well.
I could have learned foreign cultures and history more.

Anyway, I've been learning general English for about 1 year.
I feel my English has been improving, however it's not enough.
I can't speak English smoothly, especially I'm poor at impromptu speaking.
I often can't find my words and deliver my opinions.
It's frustrating. I want to fix it.

# 3. Conclude with a lead-in to the next part of the conversation

Now we can't travel anywhere due to pandemic, 
but I want to visit all over the world and enjoy it after pandemic has gone.
And also if I could improve my English, I want to change my job at a foreign company.

# My goals

My goal for learning English  are, firstly, to speak general English smoothly, frequently, and naturally.
Because I want to enjoy small talks with people who I meet in trip.
If I could do that, I could have new ideas and insights to enjoy my life
through their culture, history, and custom, I think.

Secondary is to get a job abroad, like the United States, the United Kingdom,
Singapore, Australia, or New Zealand, and so on. That is the English-speaking world.
To know other countries more, it's good idea to live there, I think.
I can improve my English skill and learn about the countries deeply. 

Finally is to get much information about new technologies.
New technologies are always published in English, papers, documents, presentation, and its movie.
I'd like to improve my technical skill more,
so that I have to be able to listen to the presentations and to read technical books and papers quickly.
I need to follow the new technologies to live as an engineer.

# My weekdays.

Nowadays I work from home due to corona virus.
