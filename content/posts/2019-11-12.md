I have teamed up with three others for three months
to tackle the training exercise about Machine Learning.
Today, I went to Osaka to give the presentation about its results.
I think that it was successful because we could answer some questions
and the audience responded well.
I submit the report and the source codes in a month, the training will be completed.

However, I must use what I learned in the training for my work.
I am still a beginner for Machine Learning,
so I will continue to learn Machine Learning and do my best at work.

On my way home, I ate Kamukura's ramen topped with spring onion and kimuchi.
It was a reward for doing my best for the training.
