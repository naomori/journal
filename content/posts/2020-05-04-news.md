I read the articles below.
And I'm thinking about my job in the near future.

1. [IT系の雇用慣行続くか](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO58711600R00C20A5TCR000/)
2. [Jobs after coronavirus: The US labor market won't bounce right back](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/15/economy/job-market-rebound-coronavirus/index.html)
3. [The U.S. economy has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic - here's what it's like for job seekers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/how-coronavirus-is-impacting-job-seekers.html)

The outbreak of COVID-19 reveals two things.
Firstly, U.S.A collects IT engineers from around the world.
Secondaly, IT startup company depends on gig workers who don't have any public welfare.
Gig workers means temporary workers.
The article said that COVID-19 will make IT companies tough to collect IT engineers and
it will make employ those gig workers as regular employee.

Another article said that lots of jobs have lost at one.
It will be back, however, it may come at a slower pace that the downturn.
A full recovery will be more likely next year than this year.
Actually it's hard to predict how long the economy will remain closed,
how deep the resession will be, and how long the recovery takes.

Companies might adopt more worker-friendly benefit policies to
protect their employees in case of another outbreak.
But this would increase the cost per employee,
and might make businesses more hesitant to hire.
So, companies might replace factory workers with robots.
The Pandemic could speed up this development further.

In conclusion, my view is that I shouldn't change my job in a few years
until companies start to recover.
And then, I should change my job of a software company
actively working on cloud and machine learning.
Moreover I have to practice job interview online video
to make sure me present myself well virtually.
That is, I should research how much an organization typically pays for a given role and
be prepared to provide clear evidence for why they are deserving of their desired salary.
