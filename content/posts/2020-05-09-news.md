## Climate change: Could the coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery?

I'm thinking about Ms. Greta Thunberg, a environment activist, reading the article below.

The drop in traffic due to corona virus is a major contributor
to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we've witnessed globally.
Most people think climate change is as serious as coronavirus.

So, people will try to avoid using public transport system for fear of infection, and
a plan of building road will be quit.
Instead of that, government will pay for improving broadband or
building paths for pedestrians and cyclists.
That is, governments might not try to prop up old, dirty industries any more.
However, the issue is causing contortions among politicians
torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the planet.

As Greta Thunberg have pushed forward the legal complaint at the UN against countries
they accuse of endangering childrenâ€™s wellbeing through the climate crisis.

From now on, the conflicts will be fierce between groups trying to prevent climate change and
those trying to promote economic recovery, I guess.
I think, we should compromise of that.
Because if we couldn't earn money from job, we couldn't keep living.
It's good for all people to get a job where a company's trying to reduce carbon emissions.
However, not all jobs will help reduce carbon emissions.

## Greta Thunberg and children's group hit back at attempt to throw out climate case

However, now people who face coronavirus can't pay attention to environmental problems, I guess.
