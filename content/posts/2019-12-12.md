I'm fine, but sleepy today.
Because at the last dinner I ate and drank too much,
so that I couldn't sleep well last night.
I ate Caesar salad, bean sprouts salad, Caprese, Lotus root tempura,
lamb stew and Matsumae-Zuke, and drank tasty sake.
The sake was brewed by Kumazawa brewery that is located in Fujisawa City.
I like the sake of Kumazawa brewery and often buy it.

Yesterday, my wife was day-off and she likes cooking, so that she cooked too much.
Those were excellent dishes, so I ate too much.
