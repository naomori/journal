## Writing: Kamala Harris to be first woman Vice President - 9th November, 2020

Kamala Harris is the U.S. Vice Presidentelect. The major television networks in the USA have announced that Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. Election.  They said Mr Biden has 279 votes in the Electoral College, which is enough for him to be elected as America's 46th President. Ms Harris will be the first woman in U.S.  history to hold the post of Vice President. She will also be the first black American and the first of South Asian descent to hold the post. Harris, 56, simply tweeted: "We did it, Joe Biden." She added: "This election is about so much more than Joe Biden or me. It's about the soul of America and our willingness to fight for it. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Letâ€™s get started."

Kamala Harris has been a rising star in the Democratic Party for the last two decades. She served as California's attorney general before becoming a US senator. She ran to become the nominee for the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign but lost to Joe Biden. However, Mr Biden chose her as his running mate. They will be sworn in as President and Vice President on January 20.  Jemele Hill, writing in the Atlantic magazine, said: "Harris' ascent to the vice-presidency is certainly a reflection of what's possible. She has accomplished something that no other black woman has. I can't help but daydream about Harris someday stepping one level up to the presidency."
