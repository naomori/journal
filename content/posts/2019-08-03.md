I cleaned my laptop XPS 13.

I have used my laptop as Xubuntu 18.04 LTS,
but unfortunately, I couldn't activate the function of palm-detection.
So I had to use a mouse and it was very tiring.

I re-installed Ubuntu-18.04.2 LTS into my laptop XPS 13.
Fortunately, palm-detection works!
I can't understand why it works, but I'm released from a mouse.
