# 1. This summer I'm definitely going to

This summer I'm definitely going to learn algebra and statistics.

I learned algebra and statistics when I was in high school and university,
but I haven't used them very much recently.
Because I used to use sophisticated software libraries, so I didn't have to use them.

However, I have to use them from now on to understand
the theory of machine learning and deep learning.
I felt that math was difficult during my student years,
but now I feel it more difficult.
Probably because I don't have enough time to understand them well, I think.

So, I'm gonna learn math in this summer definitely,
and then I will try to learn machine learning and deep learning.

I should submit my homework for AI training which I participate in.
The deadline of it is the first day after summer holidays.
They say "Study hard in this summer!", I think.

# 2. My favorite summer memory is

My favorite summer memory is 
- 5年前に頭超えの大きな波に乗ったこと。
- 当時は福岡に居た。
- 宮崎にはキャンプとサーフィンしによく行ってた。
- そのとき、台風がやってくる1日前で風はまだ弱く波が大きかった。
