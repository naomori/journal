# 1. This summer I'm definitely going to

This summer I'm definitely going to learn algebra and statistics.

I learned algebra and statistics when I was in high school and university,
but I haven't used them very much recently.
Because I used to use sophisticated software libraries, so I didn't have to use them.

However, I have to use them from now on to understand
the theory of machine learning and deep learning.
I felt that math was difficult during my student years,
but now I feel it more difficult.
Probably because I don't have enough time to understand them well, I think.

So, I'm gonna learn math this summer definitely,
and then I will try to learn machine learning and deep learning.

I should submit my homework for AI training which I'm participating in.
The deadline is on the first day after summer holidays.
They say "Study hard this summer!".
