Last Saturday,
I went to a dental clinic, not for cleaning.
It's for making mouthpiece.
I sometimes grind my teeth while sleeping.
It's for preventing from that.
Cathy said that in Philippines we slap the person who grinds teeth in a sleep.
Oh, my gosh. I won't tell that to my wife.

And I went to a ophthalmic clinic for the first time.
I have never been to a ophthalmic clinic, because I have good eyes.
But from last Wednesday, when I blink, I can see a small circle for a moment.
I had a ophthalmic test, but the doctor can't find the cause.
So that I made a reservation for more ophthalmic test at another clinic.

I wish I can cure this present symptoms.
