Today I watched [Friends](https://www.netflix.com/jp-en/title/70153404) after a long time,
because I thought that I could learn daily conversation by wathing this movie.

In NETFLIX, I can download its movies,
so I can watch them during commuting.

To learn daily conversation, I will watch it twice each time.
The first time, I watch it in Japanese with English caption
to know what each its quotes mean.
The second time, I watch it in English with English caption,
so I learn pronunciation and expressions in English.

Anyway, I can learn English in a fun way.
