# Review 2022/01/16 while, during, by and with
While the pandemic has been spreading out, I also have been spreading my knowledge by studying for technical certifications.
Also during declaration of a state of emergency, I studied English and technology with my teacher and books.
I won't be defeated by the pandemic, I will overcome it and catch a opportunity to get a better job.
I guess that this pandemic will be gone in a while, maybe 1 year, at most 2 years.

# Review 2021/09/16 phrases to sound smart
I heard that you should throw most of your things away except you need to live.
It's a good point, but I don't think so actually.
The idea means that you are almost drawn with unnecessary things so that you should pick only necessary things up and make your life style simple.
However, in my opinion, you ought to have many options to live freely provided that you know how you are and what makes you happy.
Things that you have can bring you a number of solutions.
