I read the article below.

[How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52689372)

It said that U.K has making new pedestrian walkways and bike lanes
as the government gradually begins to lift the coronavirus restrictions.
Because it is one of the attempts to create more space for social distancing.

### Vocabularies I didn't know
* lift
  - something or someone upwards into the air, I know it.
  - to remove a rule or a law that says that somethings is not allowed
