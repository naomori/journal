I went to surfing this afternoon and evening.
I enjoyed surfing from 5:30pm until little after 7:00pm.
The days are getting longer in these days,
so I can enjoy surfing a lot than before.
It's very good surfing after work.
I feel tiring from work has gone.
Actually I'm exhausted after surfing, though.

Anyway, since I started to work from home, 
I have time to free than before.
So, I can enjoy everyday without stress from commuting.

After all, it's turned out that
to promote work style reforms needs huge events or disaster such as pandemic by corona virus.
We can't change ourselves easily,
however we can get over every difficulty by changing ourselves.
I proud of us who is trying to get over difficulties.
