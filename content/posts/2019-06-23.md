Today, I spent a depraved day.
I watched anime all day long.
It was [One punch man](http://onepunchman-anime.net/).

This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role,
but what is different from normal animation is that
the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong.
He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch.
He has lost the purpose of life.

I'm looking forward to
whether if he will have a strong rival or
he will find a new purpose of life.
