# Review 2021/08/11 Snack tax
I want to keep healthy until the time of death.
I don't want to waste my time to tackle with any disease.
I just want to enjoy my life with the clear brain and the clean body.

Now, I stop drinking alcohol temporary due to check up the next weekend.
If the result of the check is good, I will refrain from drinking alcohol hereafter.
I will drink sometimes probably, though.

I found a few things by temporary stop drinking.
Firstly, I'm not interrupted by micturition during sleep.
Secondly, I feel better when I wake up in the morning.
Although I like drinking, stop drinking may bring more advantages than drinking.

# Today
I worked from home today as usual.
But I went to the office to return the borrowed book.
Recently, the close contact person was found at the office,
so I left there as soon as possible.

Lately, I read books that a certain author wrote.
His name is Simon Singh.
He wrote several books about famous mathematicians, physicists, and astronomical scientists.
They are not difficult to read.
He wrote them orderly and clearly for anyone to read with fascination.
I really enjoy reading those books.
