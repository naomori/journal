# Review 2021/08/09 Lesson - Conversation

I learned about giving recommendations.

## Notes
1. Be mindful about third person singular
2. Be careful about using hesitant and hesitate
3. 'Ought to' is a bit formal than 'should' in giving advice.

## Vocabulary and the example
You ought to avoid people who you find repellent.
Because life is short, you don't have any time to waste.

### repellent
very unpleasant

## Sightseeing in Mie Prefecture
Why don't you visit Mie Prefecture, Japan?
There are many places to visit in Japan like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and so on.
Those are amazing places actually.
However, I would recommend you visiting Mie Prefecture.

Because Mie Prefecture has many tourist spots.
If you were foodie, you should visit Ise and Matsusaka.
In Ise city, there are a wide variety of tasty rice cakes.
Matsusaka city is famous for Matsusaka beef, which is the most famous tasty beef in Japan.

If you want to do some outdoor activities, how about visiting Iga and Suzuka.
You can get experience to be Ninja at Ninja house in Iga city.
Or you can drive on the formula one course at Suzuka circuit in Suzuka city.

Anyway, you ought to visit Mie Prefecture once.
You can have great experiences besides these things.
