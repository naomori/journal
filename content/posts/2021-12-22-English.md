# Review 2021/09/20 I.C.E.S. (Issue Cause Effect Solution)
I'm going to talk about this pandemic.
It's been spread out all over the world and it's still killing many people.
People need to stay home to avoid infection with the virus.
However, they don't.
They go out for their work and drink.

This is because they feel that they will not be infected with it despite of no reasons.
It's called as Normalcy bias.
It keeps people calm down to handle with difficulties.

However, it can lead them to danger under a serious situation such like now.
As a result, they tend to behave as usual in spite of the pandemic.

To solve this, they should find that the world has totally changed and they have to always wear a face-mask when they go out and should keep getting doses of vaccine.
They have to recognize that the good old days have gone forever and will never come back.
