At the yesterday's lesson, I practiced linking words and
learned expressions to have someone agree with me.
Moreover, I talked about technology matters, what technology bring us,
good things and bad things.

I was given homework to speak about movies what I've ever watched
showed highest future technology.
To be precise,
What do you think is the peak of technology and provide similar movie about it.
Do short presentation.

I remember some movies I've watched.
It's "2001 a space odyssey", "Blade Runner", "The Terminator",
"Minority Report", "Interstellar", "Ready Player One", or "Ghost in the shell".

Those movies are all amazing.
I cant' choose one, however I should.
So, I chose "Ghost in the shell".

Tomorrow, I'll prepare short presentation about "Ghost in the shell".
