At the yesterday's lesson.

I learned about the difference between assertive and aggressive.
Assertive means that you are confident and say clearly what you think or what you want
without attacking someone. It's polite and positive.
Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly,
but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.

And, I learned about phone conversation.
When you call someone, 
first, you've got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc.
Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.
Next, you state the purpose for calling,
for example, I'm calling about brah-brah, or I'd like to brah-brah, etc.
Finally, you say good-bye politely.

I didn't do well role-play phone conversations.
I couldn't imagine the scenes and respond quickly.
In addition, I couldn't use the phrase and vocabularies about friendly good-byes.
At the next lesson, I'll try to do well phone conversations.
