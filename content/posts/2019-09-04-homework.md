## Essay: Mount Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan

Mount Fuji, a representative mountain in Japan, is loved by all Japanese.
In particular, the people of Yamanashi and Shizuoka love Mount Fuji,
which straddles the two prefectures.

Yamanashi residents claim that Mount Fuji is the most beautiful viewed from the Yamanashi side,
while Shizuoka residents claim that Mount Fuji is the most beautiful viewed from the Shizuoka side.
I think however, Mount Fuji is magnificent and splendid from wherever you look, even from the sky.
