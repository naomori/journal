# Review 2022/02/16 Current Events

## Mt.Fuji volcanic eruption
Mt.Fuji is the mountain that every Japanese loves.
It brings a lot of benefits to people, like hot spring, clean water, beautiful scenery, and so on.
However it has a history that it erupted several times and brought death to people.

Now, several huge earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes has been happened these years.
So, many Japanese are afraid of a huge volcanic eruption of Mt.Fuji.
It erupted about three hundred years ago, and then buried many villages with its volcanic ash and killed lots of people.
What's more, it gave terrible damage to economy of those days, because there were few crops due to its volcanic lava and ash.

I wish that it will not erupt and there will be no damage from it.
