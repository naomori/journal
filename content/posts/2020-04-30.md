At the last lesson, I studied vocabulary notebook about on and off. 
I reviewed phrasal verbs and made some sentences using phrasal verbs.

From today, my holidays start.
However, unfortunately I can't go anywhere due to corona virus.
Most shops and restaurants are closed,
and the local people might not welcome people who come from other places,
because of suppressing infection of corona virus. 

Now, very gloomy atmosphere is sweeping over Japan.
Like, don't jog without mask, don't go surfing,
don't go out anywhere, stay home, something like that.
I know what they mean, but it's too submissive.
In Japan, there is no constitutions and laws to make people stay home forcibly.
On the other hands, there is strong peer pressure to make people stay home.
I hate every peer pressure. I don't like the aspect of Japanese culture.
It's kind of lynch.
