Today I went to another ophthalmic clinic.

Two weeks ago, I went to a ophthalmic clinic,
because I see a small circle for an instant in my right eye when I blink.
It's a kind of shadow that I see after I see a bright small light.
I was worried about my eyes, however, the doctor couldn't find the reason.
The doctor said, "There is no problem now, come again a month later".

So, I wanted to check my eyes again by another doctor.
The clinic is in Omotesando, Tokyo.
It's bit far from Fujisawa, it takes one and half hour.
But it seemed to me that the clinic is good.
Because the clinic can do comprehensive eye medical examination. 
I found the clinic by Google search.
It seemed to me that the clinic has enough doctors and enough medical equipment.
So that I decided to check my eyes at the clinic.

As a result, the doctor found the reason and the cure.
The reason is that the fundus of my right eye is a bit swollen and
the retina is a bit away from the fundus.
It's because of fatigue and stress.
And the cure is to take enough rest.
I was relieved to hear that the symptom is treatable.

Three weeks later, I'm gonna go to the clinic to check out my eyes by fundus expert doctor.
