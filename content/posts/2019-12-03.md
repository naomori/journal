At the last lesson, I learned problems and solutions, and I remembered some vocabularies.
For example, do the math. You use "do the math", when you do easy addition or subtraction.
On the other hand, you use "calculate", when you use a numerical expression.

And newly wed. It's me. It means a person who got married recently.
I told my teacher that I've got married this March and
when and where I and my wife met for the first time,
so she said to me, "You're a newly wed!".

And vibrant. It means bright and strong colour.
When I told her the difference between Osaka people and Tokyo people,
When I said about typical Kansai old ladies,
I said "They always wear animal print clothes, like leopard, tiger or lion".
So, she said "They like vibrant colour, don't they?".

And compensation. It means earning money for doing job.
When I told her about my basic stance for my carrier,
I said, "I'll chose an interesting job, not much money".
"I will do an interesting job, and earn money with other methods, like investing".

Anyway, I have a runny nose.
It's tough to breath, so my head is a bit numb.
I'll leave the office early and go back home.
