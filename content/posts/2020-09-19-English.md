They are what I couldn't say what I wanted to say.

### Why did the current prime minister of Japan quit?

It's because he has a health problem and it has been worse,
so he decided not to keep his post.
He has been the prime minister before at once, it was fourteen years ago.
He resigned from his post at that time because of his health problem.
That is, he resigned twice from the prime minister.

### How do Japanese people choose the next prime minister of Japan?

Japanese people can't choose the prime minister directly.
Japanese prime minister is chosen by members of Congress.
Japan has a political system similar to England. It's the parliamentary democracy.
So, there is no president who chooses the prime minister.

### Is Japanese eating manner making a sound when eating noodles?

No, it isn't.
Japanese people don't think to make a slurping sound intentionally when eating noodles.
I think there are two reasons.
Firstly, they use chopsticks and don't use a fork that wraps pasta around.
Secondly, they don't close their face to a bowl or a dish.
Because it's a bad manner for eating.
Therefore, they slurp noodles eventually making a slurping sound.

On the other hand, the color of the soup of western Udon is light.
