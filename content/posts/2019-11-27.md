I took a morning day off this Wendesday. I went to dental clinic to have my teeth cleaned. Because the clinic is very popular and I couldn't make an appointment the weekends. Then, I had a anesthesia injection but it was so painful. In the early morning Wendesday, I went to surfin. There were good waves, and less surfers than weekends.

I'll take a morning day off from now on, sometimes.
