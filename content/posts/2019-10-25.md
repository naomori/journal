In the previous lesson,
I studied about healthy food and told what is in my fridge.
And I gave my opinions for some beliefs about food.

One of beliefs what I heard of is that
eating a bowl of salad at the beginning of a meal can give you a feeling of fullness
and prevent overeating. And also chewing 30 times per mouth can prevent overeating.

In these days, I always overeat at dinner, so from now on I'll do those methods.
