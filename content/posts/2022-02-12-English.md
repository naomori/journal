# Review 2021/08/29 Reading comprehension and Application of the OREO method
Japanese have been made many Japanese English so far.
"Heartful" is one of them.
What do you imagine from the word?
Japanese use the word as "heart-warming".
I didn't know it's the Japanese English, actually.
Those Japanese English make English learners in Japan, including me.
I hope that they will be gone and many Japanese will use English correctly, including me.
