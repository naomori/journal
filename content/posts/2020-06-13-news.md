I've read the new below.
Because Coronavirus social-contact curbs effect also adults, not only adolescents, I think.

* [Coronavirus social-contact curbs 'put adolescents at risk'](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53022369)

Scientists define adolescence as between 10 and 24 and regard them as a vulnerable stage to prepare for adult life.
Because it's key time for the development of the brain and 
it's also the period in life when mental-health problems are likely to develop.

Reduced face-to-face contact among adolescents and their friends during the pandemic 
could have damaging long-term consequences, neuroscientists say.
Scientists say that the lack of face-to-face contact effects learning and memory of adolescents badly.

And social media can make up for the negative effects.
Actually some studies have shown that active social-media use increases well-being.
However, the studies have shown also that passive uses of social media negatively influence well-being.

That is all the article said.

The article got me thinking.
In my opinion, the social-contact curbs effect everyone not only adolescents.
For instance, I have worse memory in English than in Japanese. 
That is, I'm always under lockdowns in English.
It means that the lack of occasions to make words from thoughts makes me have worse memory, I think.
Because to make words from thoughts and give a presentation, 
you should memorize it and keep thinking during speech.
It makes you practice memorizing and thinking.
That is, the social-contact makes such as occasions.

So, extroverted people can get more such occasions to practice than introverted.
However, I'm not extroverted, so I should write more something articles or diaries instead of talking.
