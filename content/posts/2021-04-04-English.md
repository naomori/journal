## Today

Last week, I was preparing for Amazon certification exam.
I went for having the exam yesterday and I passed it.
The exam is not difficult, but I'm always a bit nervous for exams.
Because taking the exam is not free and it takes some time to prepare the exam, so I don't want to waste my money and time.
Anyway, I felt relieved to pass it.

Today, I took a walk looking at cherry blossoms and going to the nearest shrine to pray. I prayed for my family's heath and wealth.
Last week there were some windy days, so cherry blossoms are going to fall.
I like the bloom of cherry blossoms and like also they're falling.
Cherry blossoms are beautiful because they fall. It means the fragility of the world.

How about your day-off?
What were you doing?
