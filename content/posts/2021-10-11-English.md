# Review 2021/10/11 Touchstone3 (ALEX)

I practiced using superlatives for emphasis.

What advice would you give to someone visiting your country for the first time?

Have you visited Japan before?
If you haven't never come to Japan, you should visit Kyoto that is the previous capital city until four centuries ago.
It has lots of historical temples and interesting cultures.
You can walk around Kyoto in Kimono, which is Japanese traditional dress.
So, the most tourisms come to Kyoto from overseas and all around Japan.

Do you want to try Wagyu when you visit Japan?
Yeah, you really should, shouldn't you?
Kobe Wagyu is the most famous Japanese beef in the world, isn't it?
However, it's not like that in Japan.
Matsusaka beef is the one.
What's more, Miyazaki beef is the most delicious and has a reasonable price.
If you have Japanese friends, you should ask them to order it.
Since logistics control improves in Japan, you can take it soon.
Therefore, you can enjoy Japanese food wherever you stay.
Of course, you can enjoy the best local food when you visit the place where produces it though.

I worked from home today as usual.
There was nothing special.
