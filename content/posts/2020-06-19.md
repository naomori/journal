At the yesterday's lesson,
I started Lesson B Ups and downs.
I learned about guessing how people feeling using adjectives ending in -ed and -ing.

On the other hand, I couldn't talk well about few things below.
* Why Japan has lots of earthquakes?
* What difference is between tsunami and waves?
* Do you think that tsunami might attack you? What do you do for it?


By the way, I worked from home today as ordinary weekdays.
It's windy and rainy today, and unfortunately there is no waves.
I wish I could have gone surfing.
