# Unit-8: What if?
## Lesson.D: Any regrets?

### 1. Reading

#### A. What kinds of things do people regret in life? Make a class list.

I think...
Some people wish they had got married with another partner.
Because some Japanese husband and wife are always complaining about their partner.

And,
Someone who had a car accident wishes he had paid more attention, I think.
Especially someone is still suffering from the aftereffects of the car accident.

Finally,
I wish I had learned English to be able to speak naturally and smoothly.
But I tend to save the best for the last,
and now I enjoy learning English so it's OK.

#### B. Read the blog. What impression do you have of the writer(age,gender,personality)? Compare ideas with a partner?

#### 1.
The person would be 40 or 50 years old, I guess.
He or She has been cared about many things, small and big.
He or She has been uptight so far.

#### 2.
The person would be 40 years old, I guess.
Because it's similar to me.

#### 3.
The person would be selfish and busy man.
And he or she doesn't have many friends.

#### 4.
The person would be introverted and busy man.

#### 5.
#### 6.
