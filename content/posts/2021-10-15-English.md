[T-Mobile's New Robot Can Tattoo People Remotely](https://eikaiwa.dmm.com/app/daily-news/article/t-mobiles-new-robot-can-tattoo-people-remotely/96FbmJEIEeuIFfemAonEvA)

## Vocabulary and the example
I'm intense in studying English and for technology vendors' exams.
That's because I'd like to earn more money and enjoy my work more.
When it comes to skills, minimalist doesn't make a sense.
To enjoy whole life, I'd like to acquire skills to live more comfortably and have a lot of fun to do what I want to make, not ornately.

By the way, I feel it's difficult to segue into another topic when I discuss in English.
I'm afraid of hurting someone's feelings who is having fun talking about a topic by interrupting.
It's also in Japanese, I find.
Anyway, I'd like to improve my communication skill in English as well as in Japanese through learning English.

### segue, ANT: halt, interruption
to move smoothly from one song, idea, activity, condition etc to another

### intense, ANT: gentle, kind, lazy
having a very strong effect or felt very strongly

### minimalist, ANT: ornate
a style of art, design, music etc that uses only a very few simple ideas or patterns

# Today

Today is fine.
It's Happy Friday.
But I have no plan of this weekend.
I will be just relaxed this weekend, studying, shopping and surfing.
It's an ordinary and peaceful weekend.

I'm working from home.
