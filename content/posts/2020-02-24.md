At last lesson, my teacher Cathy said that
I have to research about Zen and I have to tell her what is Zen and how to do Zen.
It's difficult to explain about Zen, I think.
Because Zen is one of religions, so it must be complicated and confusing.
At first, I searched Zen by Google.

Zen is one of training of Zenshu.
Zenshu is one sect of Buddhism, and
the goal of Zenshu is to attain spiritual enlightenment.
I understand that it means to know how to live as a true person or how to live your own style..

Zen is the method to be a mental condition to know how to live.
The goal of Zen is
to reach your mind,
to find yourself in your mind, and
to control your mind completely.

How to do Zen?
You sit cross-legged and
adjust your posture properly,
control your breathing, and
unify your mind.
In general, when you do zen, you do while sitting.
It's called Zazen.

Moreover, Zen and meditation are not same.
They are different with their goals.
Goals of meditation are to lower your stress and heal your mind.
That is to say, Zen is a religious method, on the other hand,
meditation is a medical method.
