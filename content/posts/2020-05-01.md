My holidays start.
However, it's not holiday in a sense because of corona virus.
I could have stayed Cebu.
If there isn't corona virus, I could stay Cebu for studying English.

There is nothing for it but to avoid infecting with corona virus
and study English at home.
I'll think about improving my English and technical skill during this holidays.

Still, I spent lazy time today.
I studied little bit English, but I just ate and jogged.
I should spend more time to study English and machine learning.
I'll do it, because I want to work abroad and enjoy different cultures.
