I met my friend who lives in England.
She came to Japan last Monday, I'm glad that
there was no typhoon on the day she arrived in Japan.

My wife had lived in England for 9 years.
My wife graduated from a British university and got a job.
My wife and she met at the workplace, they were working together.

We went to a Yakiniku restaurant in Fujisawa.
We ate, drank, and talk much together.
It was a lot of fun.

Moreover, she gave us some British souvenirs;
shortbread, chocolate sweets, and tea.
The tea was tremendous! It contained 1,100 tea bags.
Even if I and my wife drink the tea every day, 
it will take a year and a half before it disappears.
We were so laughing at the enormous volume.
