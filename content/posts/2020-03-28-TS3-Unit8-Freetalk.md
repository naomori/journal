# Unit-8: What if?
## Free talk: 8.What would you do?

### 1. If you had an hour to spare right now, what would you do?

If I had an hour to spare right now, I would take a nap.
Because I couldn't sleep well last night.
I wake up at 3 am in these days, I don't have no idea.
And I sometimes can't sleep again.

### 2. If you had one month of free time, what would you do?

If I had one month of free time, I would go to Cebu for learning English.
I hardly can take a long vacation and it's useful to improve English skill.

I wanna go to Cebu for learning English,
however, I can't go to Cebu unless Corona virus is calmed down.

### 3. If you had to choose one thing to keep throughout your life, what would it be?

It would be freedom.
I don't want to do whatever I don't want.
I don't want to be a person whoever someone wants me to be.
I want to use my time for free.
I want to do only what I want.

### 4. If you had to choose one electronic gadget to live without, what would it be?

It wouldn't be a smartphone.
I use it for everything now, to pay money, to communicate with others,
to collect information and to put all my memories in it.

So, it would be a TV.
I can get all information from Internet.
I can read news papers, watch movies, listen to music and meet my friends on Internet.

### 5. If you could invite a famous person to a party, who would you invite?

I would invite a rock band, Extreme or 10-feet.
And then I would ask them to perform on the party.
Good music is the complement to a lively party, I think.

### 6. If you could be like one person, who would you want to be like?  

If I could be like one person, I want to be like Rob Machado.
He was a great competition surfer, but he was retired from competition due to injure.
Now he is a free-surfer.
He makes surfboard and rides waves around the world using it.
He surfs very relaxed and enjoy it so much.
He is enjoying his life relaxed, I think.
I want to enjoy my life relaxed like him.

### 7. If you could have any job, what kind of work would you do?

I would work on a computer and Internet, as a software engineer.
It's the same with now.
I like to connect person to person or things to things using software. 
Relationship and connection can improve our life, I believe.

### 8. If you could have one special talent, what would it be?

It would be a multi-lingual translator.

I thought that it would be kind of a genius mathematician or genius scientists.
There are so many geniuses in the world, however,
it seems to me that they aren't happy
because people around them, even their family, can't understand what they see.
They are always feeling lonely, I guess.

On the other hand, multi-lingual skill would have me
to connect with so many people, and artifacts which people created.
It would have me happy, I think.

### 9. If you had to give up one habit, what would it be?

It would be watching smartphone.
It wastes my time.
If I could give up watching smartphone,
I would read books and study English more.

### 10. If you could do one thing over, what would you do?

I would start learning English earlier before.
I could know about around the world in more details.
Furthermore I could learn more interesting technical skill.
It would have me happier.
