# Review 2021/10/17 Conversation (KAT)
I learned about modal verbs for deductions about the past

## A. must have
We use **must have** + *past participle* when we feel sure about what happened.

## B. might have / may have
We can use **might have** or **may have** + *past participle* when we think it's possible that something happened.

## C. can't have / couldn't have
We use **can't have** and **couldn't have** + *past participle* when we think it's not possible that something happened.

## Vocabulary and the example
We can communicate with each other better if we have consideration for others.
To be thoughtful, we need to consider another aspect of others.
For example, when someone looks nervous, we can imagine that he might have had some troubles.
Or, when a talkative person doesn't say anything today, we could deduce that she must have had something sad.
Just saying "Can I help you?" can help people in trouble.

If we simply say that people who look irritated are selfish, we can't help people who might have had troubles.
If we could imagine that, we will be able to make the world better.
Compassion is not for other people's benefit, so we should have consideration for others to live comfortably, shouldn't we?

### hook up with something
to arrange for someone to meet or work with another person or organization

### deduction
1. the process of using the knowledge or information you have in order to understand something or form an opinion, or the opinion that you form
2. the process of taking away an amount from a total, or the amount that is taken away

## Notes
Be mindful prepositions.

* in the morning, in the evening
* at night, at noon

# Today

Today is rainy, windy and chilly as well as yesterday.
I feel bit tired and I'm lazy this weekend.
I slept until noon Saturday and Sunday both.

I went surfing yesterday, and I went shopping today.
How are you? Is there anything special?
