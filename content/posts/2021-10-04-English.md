# Review 2021/10/04 Touchstone3 (ALEX)

The Japanese archipelago is a group of many islands that form the country of Japan.
Although I was born and raised in Japan, I really don't know well how many islands are in Japan.
The number of islands which I've been to should be very small.
If this pandemic is gone, I will visit some of those islands.
For instance, I'd like to visit Hachijojima island, which is located south from Tokyo.
Although I'm not sure how long it will take to get there by airplane from Tokyo, I think it will not take too long.
Anyway, you can enjoy scuba diving, snorkelling, hiking in the primeval forest, feeling great nature.

# Today
I worked from home as usual.

The last weekend, I studied for an exam of technical vendor, Amazon.
And I had the exam yesterday.
It took three hours long so that I was very tired.
However, I passed it, so I'm relieved.
Since I had studied for the exam for two months,
I don't want to study for it more.
It's tough to keep studying for one thing for a long time, isn't it?
It can make you bored and tired.

Anyway, I will study for another technical exam hereafter.
Keep learning can bring you an opportunity to enjoy life, isn't it?
