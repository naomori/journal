# Review 2021/09/16 Phrases to sound smart

* Good point, but
* You make a valid point. I'd like to put another perspective on the table for discussion.
* I have a view on that

## Should we feel guilty when we travel?

You make a valid point.
As you and Ms.Greta said, airplanes might help global warming materials increase.
So people might be better to refrain from traveling in an airplane, maybe.
However, I'd like to put another perspective on the table for discussion.
People have to unite to prevent global warming, aren't they?
Do you think they will be able to do that just online?
I don't think so.
Delay of the unite means delay of the countermeasure against the warming.
They need to invest some time and carbon dioxide in the activity at this stage.
I mean your trip helps people unite with each other.
Therefore, you don't have to feel guilty when you travel.
