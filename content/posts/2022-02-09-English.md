# Review 2021/10/13 Modals(Permission and Obligation)

### What activities do you ask your parents for approval when you were a child/a teenager?

When I was a kid, my parents told me, "You can play in the daytime, but you must come home at dusk.". In addition, "You mustn't play near a river after rain, you have to keep distance from a river.".

And, "You can visit your friends' house, however you have to follow what your friends' parents said. Moreover, you must be polite for them.".
