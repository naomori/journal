At the last lesson, I talked about Silicon Valley and Annihilation.
And I answered the questions about reviews and comments for AVATAR.
I summarized a conversation about Cirque du Soleil show between Jim and Marissa.

I have a homework.
I have to write a review about concert, a show, a movie, or a book I've seen or read. 

Actually, in today's lesson, I talked just about surfing, news and movies.
So, I couldn't go forward on textbook well.
However, it was good, I think.
I want to deliver my opinions smoothly about what I'm interested in. 
So far, I haven't been able to do small talk well.
That is, it was good practice for small talks.
And that I read some news in English is good practice to read English.
I'll keep do that.
