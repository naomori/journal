It's drizzling and humid today.
I turned on an air conditioner and worked from home.
When I work at office, I can't change the temperature of the air conditioner.
It's good to set my comfortable temperature.

#### news

Recently I use an air conditioner during work and sleep.
I feel that temperature has been increasing every year
a kind of Japan might be changing to a tropical country. 
So, I've read this article.

[Why air conditioning is a vicious cycle](https://newsela.com/read/lib-air-conditioner-vicious-cycle/id/2001008996/?search_id=898f5b3c-d13d-4306-8028-fc03d44d6de1)

Air conditioners cool an area.
They remove heat from one place.
That heat is moved to another place.

Air conditioners use huge amount of energy.
The United States use about as much as electricity as all of Africa uses.

The electricity used for air conditioners comes from power plants.
These plants burn coal or oil for electricity.
Burning this fuel releases carbon dioxide. 
They warm atmosphere.

Air conditioning can also make cities hotter.
That is because it pumps heat out.
It can raise temperatures up to 2 degrees Celsius at night.
People then turn up their air conditioning to keep cool.

It's a vicious cycle.
