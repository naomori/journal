## Writing: Part2 (70, 71, 72)

70. If you get a 10-day break, what would you like to do?
    - I would like to go on a trip.
    - Because I'm tired of staying home to avoid infecting with coronavirus.
    - For instance, I want to go to a tropical island or a snowy country.
    - Therefore, I would go on a trip to somewhere if I get a long days break.
71. What would you do if your boss needs your help when you already have a plan?
    - I would ask him whether or not I can help him.
    - Because I want to help my colleagues as possible as I can.
    - For instance, they may need a help to write a report or make an experiment. 
    - So, I would help him.
72. What would you do when you leave your stuff on the train?
    - I would call a lost-and-found/lost-property office.
    - Because I could get it back if a kind someone found it.
    - To be honest, I have left my stuff behind on the train a year ago.
    - At that time, I could get it back.
