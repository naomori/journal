# Review 2021/04/11 Lesson - Elective Listening

From ride-sharing to co-working spaces and from Netflix to 3D printers all of these were at some point brand-new ideas,
and each of them had a person or people behind the idea who saw the business potential and turning their idea into reality.

American advertising executive, Lois Wise once remarked
the only people in the world who can change things are those who can sell ideas.
And most of us realized that it's not enough just to generate novel approaches.
We need to ideate, evaluate and then get buy-in to move from idea to action.
More often than not, the person whose buy-in we need is our boss.
And that's not always easy.

Our bosses are often busy with if not overwhelmed implementing their own priorities
as well as the priorities of their higher-ups.
Getting them to think about original approaches may take a backseat to handling day-to-day responsibilities.

So, let's say you have an amazing idea that you truly believe will positively impact the business and boost your own profile as well.
Congratulations but before you bombard your boss with a new pitch, do your homework and ask yourself these three questions first.

# Today and this weekend

I had my hair cut today.
I'm doing good today.
It was fine and comfortable today.
Today, I had my hair cut in the morning, and I take a walk and went to the library to take a book back in the afternoon.
Yesterday, I drive to the supermarket and enjoyed shopping.
I bought food, drink and some commodities.
I didn't go surfing this weekend because there were too small to surf.
I was a little disappointed about that.
