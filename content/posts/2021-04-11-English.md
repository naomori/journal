# Today and this weekend

I had my hair cut today.
I'm doing good today.
It was fine and comfortable today.
Today, I had my hair cut in the morning, and I take a walk and went to the library to take a book back in the afternoon.
Yesterday, I drive to the supermarket and enjoyed shopping.
I bought food, drink and some commodities.
I didn't go surfing this weekend because there were too small to surf.
I was a little disappointed about that.
