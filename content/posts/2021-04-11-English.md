# Today and this weekend

I'm doing good today.
It was fine and comfortable today.
I had my hair cut and then I take a walk and went to the library to take a book back.
Yesterday, I drive to the supermarket and enjoyed shopping.
I didn't go surfing this weekend because there were too small to surf.
