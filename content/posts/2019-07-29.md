I worked from home today and last Friday.

Japanese government encouraged office workers
to work from home last week and this week.
Because the Tokyo Olympics will be held at the same time next year.
They want to control the traffic jam at that time.

Therefore, I worked from home last Monday, last Friday and today.
Moreover, I'll work from home next Wednesday and next Friday, too.

I'd like to work from home everyday,
because it's very tiring to commute every day.
