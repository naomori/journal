I and my wife came to Miyazaki city to visit my father-in-law 
who is going to have an surgery tomorrow.

He has been at a hospital in Miyazaki city from 31 July and
had some health checks for the surgery.
He looked fine, but he was a little bit nervous.
Because he's never stayed at a hospital and had a surgery.
He seemed to be bearing up so as not to worry his family. 

I really prayed the succeed of his surgery.
