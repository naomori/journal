I hurt my right wrist last week.
It's because of too much typing keyboard and mouse click, I guess.
So, I went to a doctor to have my right wrist seen.
I had my arm taken a x-ray picture then.
The doctor said that one of my arm bone is little longer than ordinary.
That is, when I move my wrist right and left, the bone tend to push the cartilage.
That may hurt the cartilage.

The doctor gave me pain killers and poultices.
It still hurts, though.
I hope that it's cured soon.
