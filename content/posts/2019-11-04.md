At the last lesson, I studied how to use too, too much, too many and enough.
And I learned letting another person decide and polite refusals.
And convenient is a useful word.

My teacher noticed me that
I need to expound answers to produce more sentences and make more sentences with varying patterns.
"Speak more, or you can't improve. You speak more, you can get occasions to improve."

Yes, I will.
Next time, I'll try to speak a lot about reviewing, questions,
what happened this week, and how I feel about that.
