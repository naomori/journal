# Review 2022/02/16 Current Events (BEA)
[Tonga trying to clean up after tsunami and volcano](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2201/220120-tonga-tsunami.html)

## Vocabulary
### unprecedented
never having happened before, or never having happened so much

### lava
hot liquid rock that flows from a volcano, or this rock when it has become solid

## Pyroclastic flow and volcanic cinders
There are many volcanoes in Japan.
And many people were killed and suffered from volcanic eruption.

A volcano, which is located in Nagasaki Prefecture, erupted thirty years ago.
It killed forty three people by a pyroclastic flow.
Many people had never known the pyroclastic flow at that time.
A pyroclastic flow is a dense, fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter that flows along the ground away from a volcano at average speeds of 100km/h.
The gases can reach temperatures of about 1,000 degrees Celsius.
Now, most of us know its danger.

On the other hand, volcanic cinders also are scary.
A volcano in Nagano Prefecture exploded eight years ago.
Sixty three climbers were killed by flying rocks from the volcano.
It's the worst volcanic disaster after the World War II.
Three meters wide rocks at the most killed people.
Those rock flied at speeds of 300km/h.
Nobody can avoid them.

Both of those disaster have a common feature that they had indications before the disaster.
There had been a few small pyroclastic flows in Nagasaki, and also many tiny earthquakes in Nagano.
We should concern such signals from nature and keep distance those volcanoes.
