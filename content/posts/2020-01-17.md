At the yesterday's lesson, I reviewed Unit 4 to 6 through some exercises.
It's about ways to talk about the future and food.
Again I tried to get off the phone, I didn't do well though.
I couldn't end the conversation smoothly and naturally.


I finished Unit 4 to 6 at last,
so next lesson, I'm going to begin Unit 7 about relationships.
I'm little worried whether I can do well, because I'm introverted.
Anyway, I'll do my best.
