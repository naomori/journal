# This weekend

Today it was windy.

Last Friday, I took a day off and went on a trip with my wife.
We ate sushi for lunch on the way to a hotel where we stayed.
That was so delicious.
We ate out for the first time in a long time, that's since when this pandemic happened.

After that we went to a hotel.
I had reserved a room with hot spring outdoor bathroom.
The room is an old fashioned Japanese style room.
It was more like a house than a room.
Each room is separated with each other completely and we can have privacy.

We were just relaxed and have delicious meals which are local fish, meat and vegetables. Of course with sake.
Moreover, we took a bath several times.
That was really comfortable and we could feel refreshed totally.

That was nice trip completely.
