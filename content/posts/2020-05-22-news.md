I've read this news.
The title is [Why time seems to be going faster while we are in lockdown][].

I haven't been able to summarize this yet, 
because I haven't still organize my opinion about it.
However I feel it's so interesting.
I'll organize my opinion and summarize it.

...
### Short version
The article said that As parts of the world begin to ease their lockdowns,
some people are looking back and finding the time in isolation seems to have gone surprisingly fast. 

It is because we create our own subjective experience of time in our minds and
it doesn't always match up with what we read on the clock on the calendar.

We estimate time passing in two ways: prospectively and retrospectively.
"Prospectively" means "how fast is time passing right now?", and
"Retrospectively" means "how fast did last week or the last decade go by?".

During lockdown, people isolated from friends, family and work have had long days to fill.
However, inevitably when they spend every day and every evening at home,
the days begin to feel a little similar.

This blurring of identical days leads us to create fewer new memories,
which is crucial to our sense of time perception.
Memories are one of the ways that we judge how much time has passed.

When you go on holiday for a week to a new place,
the time goes fast while you’re away because everything is new.
It is a prospective way.
But when you get home, you look back and have made so many new memories 
that it often feels as though you’ve been away for far longer than a week.
It is a retrospective way.

The opposite can happen in lockdown.
Even if the days feels slow, when you get to the end of the week and look back,
retrospectively estimating how much time has passed,
you have made fewer new memories than usual and time seems to have disappeared.

We can remember where we were or when it's happened,
when we hear about really huge events.
It's called flashbulb memories and it's can be time marker in memories.
But, because of the lack of time markers during lockdown, all the days merge into one.
That is the reason for why time seems to be going faster while we are in lockdown.

The article said another something interesting.
It's a difference among people's perception of time.

Before telling that, let me ask you one question.
The question is that
"Next Wednesday's meeting has been moved forward two days."
"What day is the Wednesday's meeting now?"

People, who answered it's Monday, see themselves as static, with the future moving towards them.
People, who answered it's Friday, see themselves as moving into the future. 

Roughly half of us see the future as something which comes towards us, while we stay still,
while the other half see ourselves as moving forward into the future.

The sense of time perception can be affected by journeys or huge events.
Lockdown might temporarily turn more of us into Monday people,
forced into waiting for the future to come towards us.


### Long version
The article said that As parts of the world begin to ease their lockdowns,
some people are looking back and finding the time in isolation seems to have gone surprisingly fast. 

It is because we create our own subjective experience of time in our minds and
it doesn't always match up with what we read on the clock on the calendar.
A 20-minute lunch with a friend goes by in a flash,
while a 20-minute wait for a delayed train cal feel interminable.

We estimate time passing in two ways: prospectively and retrospectively.
"Prospectively" means "how fast is time passing right now?", and
"Retrospectively" means "how fast did last week or the last decade go by?".

During lockdown, people isolated from friends, family and work have had long days to fill.
People have found all sorts of inventive ways to pass the time, like
baking bread, planting sees, creating video.
However, inevitably when they spend every day and every evening at home,
the days begin to feel a little similar.

This blurring of identical days leads us to create fewer new memories,
which is crucial to our sense of time perception.

We may remember where we were when we heard that
the virus had reached the country we live in or
that lockdown had been announced.
It's called flashbulb memories and they’re common when we hear about really huge events.

But, because of the lack of other markers in time,
lockdown had begun we might find the subsequent weeks hard to differentiate.
Like people couldn't went out to celebrate someone's birthday,
couldn't start a new job, or couldn't attend some events, and so on.
When you can rarely leave your home,
these time stamps aren’t there all the days merge into one.

That is the reason for why time seems to be going faster while we are in lockdown.
