Today, I worked for the Cloud development team for the first time. 
The task what I did was connecting PlayStation 4 controller with Raspberry Pi 4 Model B,
and confirm the buttons which you pressed on the controller.
It was so easy, but I was pleased with helping them.

I've got to make up my mind what I should do in the Cloud development team.
I'm thinking about building the development and operating environment of Machine-Learning
with AWS and Jetson Nano.
We gonna have to use inference of Machine-Learning on the edge device in the near future.
So that I might want to prepare building the environment for the future.
Anyway, I'm interested in applying Machine-Learning to actual our product.
I've been looking forward to be engaged in like this work.
