## Vocabulary and the example
Recently, it's been warming due to climate change so that we definitely need air-conditioner in the summer.
However, when we didn't have an air-conditioner in the past, we usually use a Japanese fan, a bamboo blind, water sprinkling, a wind-bell, and eat a water-melon in Japan.
A Japanese fan brings you wind gently, a bamboo blind effectively makes enough shade to prevent you from sunlight.
The heat of vaporization from water sprinkling is useful to lower the temperature.
Sound from a wind-bell makes you feel cool emotionally, and a water-melon has vitamin and mineral to make you cool.
In addition, nowadays the yukata is being reevaluated not only to stay cool in the summer, but also from the perspective of fashion.

1. the quality of being honest and willing to talk about things

### conviction
