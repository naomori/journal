## Self-Introduction

Good evening, Ms.Cassey.  
How are you doing?  
...  
I'm grad to hear that. I'm doing good, too.  
...  

I'd like to introduce myself.  
I'm Naoki Morita.  
I'm residing in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan.  

How about you?

Nice to meet you, too, Ms.Cassey.

### Job

I'm a software engineer.
I majored in information technology at graduate school.
I've worked in the software and network field for eighteen years.

### English

I began to learn English at MeRISE last May.
I'd like to speak English smoothly and fluently for traveling, a job interview and catching up with new technology.

### Goals of English

I have three goals for learning English.
Firstly, I want to enjoy trip to foreign countries, I can't go anywhere now due to this pandemic, though.
Secondly, I want to work for international company using English, or work abroad.
Lastly, I need to catch up with new technology so that I need to read technical documents and books, and to attend international conferences.
I'd like to enjoy English class to improve my English.

### Marriage

I've got married last March and I honeymooned in England, Scotland, Canada and America.
I had a lot of fun. I want to visit again.
However, my wife blamed me for not being able to relax.
Yeah, I know. Because it was a really busy trip with many moving.
So, when I travel next time, I will stay in one place and have relaxing time.

### usual weekdays

I usually work from home since this March.
It's because of the pandemic.
Pandemic is too bad, however,
I prefer the current working style to before the pandemic.
I don't have to commute to work. It takes one and a half hours for one way.
It was a waste of time and kept giving me stressed.
I don't wanna commute anymore, even after pandemic has gone.
I'm working from home comfortably, now.

### usual weekends

I usually go shopping, and jogging or surfing.
I like surfing.
Because I can feel free by riding waves.
Surfing can relieve my stress.
And it's definitely fun, I enjoy it.

The nearest beach is a 10 minutes bike ride from my apartment.
I always go there for surfing.
