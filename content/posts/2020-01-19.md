This weekend was relaxing days.
I went to the city library and borrowed a book,
the title is "Talking to My Daughter About the Economy.".
I didn't read it yet.

After that I went to shopping at near super market and bought lots of food and drink.
Because I had a trip to Aomori two weekends ago, so that I couldn't go to shopping.

In addition, I run at the seaside for about 1 hour, 10 kilo meters.
Moreover, I walked around the town for about 2 hours to play Dragon Quest Walk game,
it's like Pokemon go.

I must have muscle ache tomorrow.
