# Review 2021/10/14 Touchstone3 (ALEX)
I learned supporting sentences.

## Homework: Ise Jingu

Ise Jingu, located in Mie Prefecture where I was born and raised, is the most famous shrine in Japan.
Ise Jingu, includes 125 shrines, centered around Naiku, dedicated to Amaterasu-Omikami, the goddess of the sun in Japanese mythology.
It is one of Shinto's holiest sites and a major pilgrimage center and tourist spot.
Many people worship every New Year's days, even Japanese Emperor and Prime minister.
It is said that ten million visitors, one-tenth of population of Japan, worship there a year,
I also used to worship there every year when I lived in my hometown, Ise city.
Although I restrain ourselves from visiting tourist spots, includes Ise Jingu, now, I hope that we can feel free to visit there in the near future.

# Today

I worked from home today as usual.
There was nothing special.

It was fine today, so I wanted to go surfing.
However, I was busy and I couldn't do it.
