English school where I have classes lifted restrictions of having online class.
However, I'll keep having English lesson online.
Because I don't want to ride crowded train and 
I'm little worry about having a class in a small booth.

Today I had online seminars about Amazon Web Services. It was interesting.
Moreover, not only Amazon but also tech companies are going to hold various online seminars next month.
I'm looking forward to those online classes.
