# Review 2021/05/07 Lesson - Pronunciation

I learned "ar" sound at today's class.
Next time, I will learn word connection again.
I should review it.

## Notes
1. I should practice more word connection to speak naturally and smoothly.
2. I should speak or read lighter, not too strong, with happy feeling.

## Vocabulary

### go off
if an alarm goes off, it makes a noise to warn you about something

### lick
to move your tongue across the surface of something in order to eat it, we it, clean it etc
