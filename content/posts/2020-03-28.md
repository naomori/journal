I had worked from home in the last few days, same like last weeks.
A governor asked citizens to avoid nonessential outings this weekend.

But I'm gonna go to have an English offline class.
Of course, I can take it online, but I wanna do offline.
To study English smoothly, offline class is important.
There are time gap and I can't see teacher's mouth behavior offline.

I wanna contain the spread of corona virus and
I will care about infection seriously.
I do washing hands and wear a mask.

I'll try to learn English more whilst care about corona virus enough.
