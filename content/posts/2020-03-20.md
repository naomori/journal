At the last lesson, 
I answered several questions about the blog about regrets,
and I learned some vocabularies below.
* relatable
* sheltered
* tough
* hard on
* problematic

I wanna make sentences using those vocabularies.

I don't want to be sheltered by anyone.
All relatable things of me is under my responsibility.
Even when something is hard on me - tough on me,
I wanna solve the problematic points by myself.
