I went to Osaka to get a lecture for Deep Learning.

I usually get motion sickness when I work on a PC while riding Shinkansen,
but this time I took a preventative medicine for motion sickness,
so I didn't feel anything wrong.

About 20 people have participated in the AI training,
and each group of 4 people will work on exercises.
The final challenge of this training is to challenge the Amazon Robotics Challenge.

The lecturers are a professor and a associate professor of Chubu University.
They specialize in computer vision, machine learning and deep learning.

Surprisingly, the associate professor was a fried of mine when I was in graduate school.
I met him for the first time in 17 years.
I enjoyed talking with him.

The lecture was interesting and I had a wonderful meeting,
so it was a good day.
