## Today

I worked from home today as usual.
There was nothing special.
I sat down and was typing a keyboard to coding a software all day.
And I couldn't wake up early, so I didn't go surfing this morning.
It is said that the early bird gets the worm, but there was no worm because I woke up late.

The last lesson, I learned the difference S and Z sound.
In today's lesson, I will learn shadowing again.
