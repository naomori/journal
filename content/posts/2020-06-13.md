I've been learning English at English school for about a year.
I want to improve my English more,
however I sometimes can't listen to what my teacher said,
and even if I can, I can't respond quickly.

In these days, I've been reading some news and summarizing it.
And I give a short speech about it in my class.
Although, I can't remember all of the speech, 
so I can't give a speech well, I read it.
That is, in English I have bad memory about listening and speaking.
It's my issue and I want to fix it.

The problem is how I should learn English and
what I should do for improving my English.
So, I just now applied for Speaking up class.

The class is gonna tell me how to learn English every day and
what I should care about for learning English.

I hope that it can help me.
