Yesterday, I had a bad condition due to pollenosis.
I had a terrible runny nose, so many sneeze, and feeling heavy.
Fortunately, I had no cough. It should not be corona virus.
Today I feel better and I could work from home.

In these days, I just work and jog.
But in rainy day I can't jog,
it would be nice if there were enough waves to surf at least.
