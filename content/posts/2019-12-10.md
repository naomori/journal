At the yesterday's lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs.
Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I've got to learn those.

And I'll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations,
because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking.
If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance,
you can find and choose your word easily.

At first I'll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like 
common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.
According to [this site](https://www.learning-english-online.net/vocabulary/).

So, I'll try to categorize the units of Touchstone vol.3.

1. common vocabulary
  - Unit.5: Food choices
  - Unit.9: Tech savvy?
  - Unit.11: Impressions
2. people
  - Unit.1: The way we are
3. private life
  - Unit.2: Experiences
  - Unit.4: Family life
  - Unit.6: Managing life
  - Unit.8: What if?
4. public life
  - Unit.7: Relationships
  - Unit.10: What's up?
5. environment
  - Unit.12: In the news
6. nature
  - Unit.3: Wonders of the world

Touchstone vol.3 covers all situations.
It's nice book!

I'll try to do that from now on.
