I spent lazy time today just like I did yesterday.
I woke up late, ate lunch, took a nap and studied little bit English.
It's too bad.
To change my job, I should improve English and technical skill.
I don't have time to waste.
I shouldn't forget it and I always have to remember it.
I have to live a regular life and keep studying during holidays.
I'll do it.
I said it yesterday as well, though.
