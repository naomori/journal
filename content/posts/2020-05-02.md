I spent lazy time today just like I did yesterday.
I woke up late, ate lunch, took a nap and studied little bit English.
It's too bad.
To change my job, I should improve English and technical skill.
I don't have time to waste.
I shouldn't forget it and I always have to remember it.
I have to live a regular life and keep studying during holidays.
I'll do it.
I said it yesterday as well, though.

I had an English lesson just now.
I talked about whether China spreads corona virus intentionally,
and Japanese culture and comparison of countries' population.
It's kind of political problem, I think.
So, it's difficult to discuss about it.

At that lesson, I reviews Units 7 to 9.
I met some vocaburaries I didn't know accurately.
They are 'moderate', 'impenetrable', 'emotionally', 'intuitively' and 'user-friendly'.

Furthermore, I have a homework that I make three 'wish' statements,
and I read some news and talk about it, deliver my opinion about it.
My teacher said that to read news and deliver your opinions is good ways to improve English skill.
I think so, too.
