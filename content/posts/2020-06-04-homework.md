I watched a film, "Annihilation".
It's a science fiction horror film.
It was released theatricaly in 2018, but it became a box office bomb.
And then it was released digitally by Netflix.
You can watch it now on Netflix.

Natalie Portman plays a biologist who entered "The Shimmer",
which is a mysterious quarantined zone of mutating plants and animals caused by an alien presence.
The Shimmer emerged three years prior from a meteor that landed in a lighthouse, and
gradually expanding and increasing its boundaries.

Many exploratory expeditions have been organized from soldiers, but nobody returned.
So, in this time, a scientific expeditions was organized, including Natalie Portman as biologist.
The expeditions enters the Shimmer, and they encounter unusually mutated plants and animals.
The Shimmer is distorting and transforming everything within in its boundaries, 
including the expedition members' own bodies.

Its visuals is mesmerizing and grotesque, and its story is thought-provoking.
You ought to watch the rest of the movie for yourself, if you haven't watch it.
