# Review 2021/09/08 countable/uncountable nouns and quantifiers
I almost always drink a little alcohol at dinner.
I like beer, wine, or sake which all are fermented liquor.
However I'm not a big fan of distilled alcohol, like whisky, or spirits.

I love sake especially.
Fortunately, there are thousands of sake in Japan.
So, I will not be bored with it.
They have various types of flavor, texture and taste.

What's more, I also love beer.
Over the past few years, the variety of craft beers has increased.
I'm not sure its reason actually, but it doesn't matter.
I'd like to drink all of it, if I can.
If I did that, I would have some diseases though.
