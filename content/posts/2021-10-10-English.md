# Today
I was too lazy today.
I did nothing, just eat and sleep.
Of course, I studied for an exam of a technology vendor, AWS.
However, that's all.

That's because I feel tired and bored with working for the current company.
I will be moved to another department, two months later.
I don't know what I will do, but probably it's not related with cloud technology.
I want to work on cloud technology, so I'm thinking how I can introduce the cloud tech into a task what I will do.
I hope that I can do that, and I wish I will get along with colleagues at the team.
Unfortunately, now I'm not get along with colleagues of my team.
I'd like to work with colleagues who know software well and take advanced methods for development, but they aren't.
I tried to introduce such methods to my team, but I failed.
Because I couldn't their agreement for that.
I'm tired of doing that, I feel that doesn't make sense.
It's good time to change the team that I belong to.
I hope there is someone there whom I would like to work with.
