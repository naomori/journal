# Review 2021/09/22 Discourse Markers

## Takeaway I had from the article below
[How to live with your regrets](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220207-how-to-live-with-your-regrets)

According to the article, most of people feel regrets that they've done or not done.
Right, I think so.
I sometimes flashed back and felt such a regret, too.
So, I wonder how I can throw those regrets away from me.
It said that the self-compassion and self-distancing are keys.
What's more, it said that you cannot change the past but you can try to make up for all your regrets.
Well, I will do that from now on.
After all, I should move forward and be confident in myself.
