Yesterday, at the English conversation lesson, I couldn't speak smoothly at all.
I couldn't find my words and speak what I wanted to.
The teacher told me to speak a lot and not to overthink,
but I don't know what I should do.
What do I have to do to speak a lot and smoothly, not to overthink?
How do I study English to do that?

I'll ask her that at next lesson,
because I have no idea even if I'm thinking about it alone.
