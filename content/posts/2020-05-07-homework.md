When I meet my friends for a long time, I catch up with them. I talk about my recent state, work, hobby, where interesting place I went recently, what something special I did, and so on.

About four months ago, my friend contacted me via facebook messenger. He is a friend when we were in a graduate school. He said "Why don't you have a reunion with our laboratory's member?". I agreed with that and I asked him to invite other members. Unfortunately, we can't have reunion because corona virus caused outbreaks and a pandemic.

The pandemic is ongoing even now in the world. It's terrible and horrible. We can't have the reunion now, but we'll have it after corona virus is calm down. I hope so.
