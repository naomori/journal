I read a few news about airlines in a few days.

* [Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway sells US airline shares](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52518186)
* [Buffett Dumps Airlines and His Aerospace Pain Will Only Worsen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-03/buffett-dumps-airlines-but-his-aerospace-pain-will-only-worsen)
* [What happenes to airliens after the coronavirus crisis ends?](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-happens-to-airlines-after-the-coronavirus-crisis-ends/)
* [Airlines Could Increase Ticket Prices After COVID-19 Lockdown](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2020/04/300961/airlines-could-increase-ticket-prices-after-covid-19-lockdown/)

Warren Buffett's company sold all of its shares in the four largest US airlines,
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines.
The article said that the COVID-19 gave tremendous damage to airlines and aircraft makers.
It will take at least three years to recover as the same as beofre COVID-19.

I totally agree with that.
Aircraft and vehicle industry have pyramid architecture.
A few master companies have lots of supplier companies,
and the supplier companies have more lots of supplier companies, and so on.
Once the architecture is broken down, it takes much time to recover.

I worry about the future of airline industry.
Because my nephew is studying in college to become an airplane pilot.
Every airlines have competed to get pilots before COVID-19, but not now.
Airliens are trying to reduce pilots.

Furthermore, I want to go to all around the world.
However, airplane tickets will be increased, I guess.

Warren Buffett said "world has changed because of the COVID-19".

So, can I ask something?
* How changes will be happend in transportation system after COVID-19?
    - Like, everybody will avoid to board aircrafts?
    - I think that's true. Everybody avoid airplane.
    - But orinary people can't avoid to use trains and buses,
        because there isn't cheaper transportation system.
* What is the biggest change after COVID-19?
    - Like, everybody will want to do everything online?
    - Exactly, we should want to do everything as possible as we can.
* What is the most valuable skill after COVID-19?
    - I think, it's communication skill as the same as before or more than before.
    - Especially, online communication skill is more important for private and business both.
    - It has been valuable even before COVID-19.
    - Like Vtuber, everybody needs to edit own video
        to deliver opinions and give presentations.
