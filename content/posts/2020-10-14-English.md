## Today

I was cloudy and comfortable temperature today.
I worked from home as usual.
I had nothing special, just worked.
In these days I do jogging or surfing every day, so I'm find.

By the way, iPhone 12 was announced today.  
It's good, however I'm not going to replace my iPhone.
Because I'm satisfied with my iPhone X, moreover new iPhone is very expensive.
In addition, I stay home most of the day, so I don't use my phone very much.
Instead of new iPhone, I want to new iPad.
I'd like to use new iPad with an apple pencil for study English.
I can use marker pen with the new iPad and an apple pencil.
I suppose I can study English more effectively. 
Also, I can read books and paint a picture on it. 
And then I can manage it as digital data.
