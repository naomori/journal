I slipped and fell down at bathroom on last Saturday.
My left elbow was cut by edge of door and hit on the floor.
It was very very hurt.

Last Saturday, I went surfing and enjoyed it.
After that, I took a shower and washed my gears for surfing.
At that time, I fell down.
My elbow was cut and swollen, so I put a band-aid and a wet compress with pain killer on it.
Now, the swelling has gone down, but it's still a bit hurt.
