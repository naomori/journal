I read the articles below.
And I'm thinking about around Japan, especially China.

* [コロナ後、世界秩序が変化　中国覇権強まる　ダリオ氏語る](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO58796020X00C20A5I00000/)
* [Global Backlash Builds Against China Over Coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/world/europe/backlash-china-coronavirus.html)

A certain founder of the largest hedge fund in USA said that
China will emerge as the dominant power in the world, 
because the US debt will expand and
the value of the US dollar as the key currency will decline.

On the other hand, the New York Times said that
global backlash builds against China
for its initial mishandling of this crisis over corona virus.
Some states in USA and some Eurpoean countries are trying to suit China for COVID-19 dames.
However, it said that it's politically impossible for Xi Jinping
to ever agree to pay any reparations. 

In addition, socialistic countries and democratic countries
will conflict for redistribution of wealth.
Actually, China gives medicals aids to many countries and threats them at the same time.

I'm afraid of the world war III between China and western countries.
I hope that the corona virus is the only one enemy.
