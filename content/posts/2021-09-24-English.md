# Review 2021/09/24 Touchstone3

## what I couldn't say
There are many wonders of the world, like the pyramid of Giza, the Great Canyon, etc.
One of the wonders of the world that I'm interested in is the Maya civilization.
There are several mystery in Maya.
The Maya people are believed to have had the most advanced technology at the time.
Because they built many huge buildings, including a kind of the pyramid.
What's more, they studied astronomy and had their own calendar and letters.
However, they had gone suddenly.
Even now, no one can find where they've gone.
As a result, it is said that the sudden lost of Maya civilization is one of the biggest mystery of archaeology.
So, I'd like to go there to see the remains of Maya some day.
