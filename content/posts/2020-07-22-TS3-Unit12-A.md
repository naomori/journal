# Unit-12: In the news

## Lesson.A: Local news

### 1. Getting started

#### A. How often do you read local news? What local news have you read recently?

I rarely read local news, because nothing happens.
I don't remember local news I've read, maybe something about Olympic games, sailing.
The Olympic sailing games is going to use Enoshima Yacht Harbor.
However, the Olympic games will be quit due to pandemic, I guess.
