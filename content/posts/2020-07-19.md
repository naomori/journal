Last weekend, I tried my new surfboard.
In short, it's an amazing surfboard.
I could take off earlier than my shorter surfboard as well as more enjoyable.
Because I could get more pushing power from waves and also feel like wave is softer than before.
Maybe the surfboard is bigger and heavier than my other surfboard.
On the other hand, I little worried about that it's little bit more difficult to ride surfboard with single fin.
However, it was a unnecessary worry. It's not unstable and likewise not slow.
I could ride waves sideways with it.
Next I'm gonna try bottom turn.
Totally I'm glad I bought that.
