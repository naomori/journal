At the last lesson, I answered a question
whose the person couldn't have time to listen to recordings of his lectures.
My advice was taking notes of his lectures,
because it doesn't take time rather than listening to the recordings.

And I learned the meanings of "on the good side" and "undecided".
And "make a difference" has positive meanings, not negative. 
And you can use "make a 'some adjective' impression", for example good, bad, intense, etc.

I couldn't find the words as same meaning as "do my best",
but I think "do with full force" or "be at full force" is right.

And "make sure" is similar with "be certain"

In the end of the last lesson,
I made sentences using No.2 expressions.
I learned facial expression, not surprised face.

My teacher said that
these vocabularies were very common and easy words, native English speakers often use them,
so you should use them often, not using complicated words.
