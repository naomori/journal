At yesterday's lesson, I learned about how to use 'already', 'still', and 'yet' with present perfect.
At beginning of the lesson, I talked about the article which I've read,
however I couldn't explain it well.
I couldn't summarize it well and couldn't deliver my opinion clearly and smoothly.
Because I didn't organize my opinion about it.
I've read news carefully with looking up words I didn't know, so far.
But it's not good to understand articles and practice conversation, I guess.
I'd better to read articles quickly and I should focus on organizing my opinion.
If I could do that, I could deliver my opinion smoothly,
and it's good for me to practice daily conversation, I think.

In addition, I learned about some idioms and words below.

* sacrifice lives for economic gains
* too mainstream
* cup of tea (idiom)
  - something you're interested in

I'll make some sentences using these idioms.

Whether something like cloths or shoes is too mainstream or not is not my cup of tea.
Whether it fits for me or not is my cup of tea.
On the other hand, I care about whether something technique is mainstream or not.
It's my cup of tea, because I should learn that skill for my job. 

All employees sacrifice lives for economic gains everyday in a way.
Because they change their life time to money.
However, it's OK provided that they are satisfied with their job, I think.
