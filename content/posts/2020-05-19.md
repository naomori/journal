At yesterday's lesson, I learned about how to use 'already', 'still', and 'yet' with present perfect.
At beginning of the lesson, I talked about the article which I've read,
however I couldn't explain it well.
I couldn't summarize it well and couldn't deliver my opinion clearly and smoothly.
Because I didn't organize my opinion about it.
I've read news carefully with looking up words I didn't know, so far.
But it's not good to understand articles and practice conversation, I guess.
I'd better to read articles quickly and I should focus on organizing my opinion.
If I could do that, I could deliver my opinion smoothly,
and it's good for me to practice daily conversation, I think.

In addition, I learned about some idioms and words below.

* sacrifice lives for economic gains
* too mainstream
* cup of tea (idiom)
  - something you're interested in

I'll make some sentences using these idioms.
