At the yesterday's lesson, I summarized blogs that the writers described their regrets.
They would have various background, some of them are similar to my thinking.
Especially the second writer, I sympathized with him or her.

And I learned several words below.
* shut away
* all that good
* hermit
* superior
* inferior
* pushy
* demand
* meant to me

I'll make some sentences with each.

#### shut away
If I'm humiliated in front of my co-workers, I want to shut myself away in my room.
For example, when I pass gas when I sneezed.

#### all that good
I was hesitated to speak English, because I wasn't all that good.
However, now I'm trying not to be hesitated to speak English even if I'm not all that good.

#### hermit
Sometimes I want to be a hermit weekend, when I'm tired of everything.

#### superior, inferior

#### pushy
I don't like pushy people.
However, I sometimes should be pushy to do what I want.

#### demand, mean to me
I don't want to do what doesn't mean to me.
But sometimes I have to do it when boss demands.

#### a combination with all of them
