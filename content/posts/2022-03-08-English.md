I began to learn English again three years ago.
Because I wanted to use English without stress during trip overseas and to enjoy the trip at the maximum.
I can't use English smoothly, so I hesitate to talk to local people.
As a result, I have been missed many opportunities to get to know their culture and history.

I know that a tip of continuing learning English is enjoying it.
Therefore, I'm trying to enjoy while I take an English class or read an article in English.
However, I feel my improvement of English less than I expect these days.
I might need something else that makes me enjoying learning.
For example, it might be a good idea to watch movies in English with English subtitles by NetFlix.
