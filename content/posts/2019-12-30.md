I received Christmas presents from my brother who lives in Michigan, America.
I love American foods, spices and snacks.

I went to America on my way of honeymoon.
I wanted to introduce my wife to my brother's family.
And I'd like to eat American and Canadian foods,
and see the Niagara falls again.

I've been there with my dad and mom three years ago.
It was an amazing experience,
but it was not enough to visit there only once.

Now I want to visit there again, however,
I don't know where to go.
Because I have many places where I want to visit.
I want to visit Iceland, Spain, Italy, Greece, Sweden, Australia,
and England and Scotland again.
I wish to go around the world.

To do so, I must win a lottery, maybe.
Or, I should earn much money.
