# Review 2021/08/22 Trip

What the worst did you experienced on a trip?

I've got food poisoning on a business trip.
It was about ten years ago when I visited Vancouver in Canada for work.
My colleague and I ate a bowl of ramen in a Korean restaurant.
At the night, I threw up a lot and had terrible diarrhea.
Unfortunately, it had kept me being down for a few days.
My colleague was under the same situation, too.
It was totally dreadful experience.
