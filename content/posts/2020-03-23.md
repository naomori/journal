At today's lesson, I talked about what I would do if I had last year to live over again.
I didn't do enough what I wanted to do last year.
I would definitely do more efficiently and effectively.
I wasted much time doing watch movies and my smart phone too much.
Furthermore I found that I had many things I wanted to do.
I sometimes should look back what I did, I thought.
I should confirm how well was what I did.
Unless I do that, I couldn't improve myself.

Moreover, I felt I talked a little bit smoothly than before.
However, I did just make a trigger of conversation.
Cathy talked a lot, on the other hand I couldn't.

I think, I should have talked more sentences after a trigger of conversation. 
And I should have listened to her whilst expressing my agreement and opinions.
Yeah, I didn't talk smoothly, I did just listened to her.
I definitely will try to talk more sentences next time.
