# Today

I worked from home today as usual.

Last week, I enjoyed surfing very much.
Because the typhoon swell reached at the nearest beach from Philippines.
I'm so sorry that many people might be suffered from the typhoon,
but I could enjoy surfing a lot.

In these days, I took a walk to around my home with my wife.
We explored our town and found a cafe or shop we didn't know.
Although we lived for four years in this town, we don't know many things.
It's fun to find something new in our town.
