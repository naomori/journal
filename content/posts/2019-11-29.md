At the yesterday lesson, I learned making plan and
the difference between "will" and "be going to".
I use "will" when I decided to do something while speaking, and
I use "be going to" when I say something that I decided before.

Today, I'm sleepy, because I had many coughs last night.
I've had taken some cold medicines, but it doesn't work.
I need a medicine stopping coughs.

By the way, I had a explanation for studying abroad yesterday.
Because I'm interested in short-term studying abroad.
I've been getting lessons for English conversation since this March, and
I'd like to improve my English skill more quickly.
Because I'd like to get a new job next year, if I can.
I want to leave the current company as soon as possible and
get the new job where I can use English and new techniques.
I should study hard until then.
