I cancelled my short-stay for learning English in Cebu
which I reserved two months ago.
It's due to corona virus.
I'm so sorry for that.
I really want to go to Cebu for learning English.
I'm thinking about how I improve my English skill during a long vacation in April and May.
I'm wondering if I get online classes, too.

Furthermore, I started to learn for being a Data Scientist in English
I'm gonna learn English in everything like studying tech and working.
