# Review 2021/06/14 Lesson - Touchstone.3

We talked about dreams which the people in the textbook tell.

## what I couldn't say but I wanted to say

If I can, I would like to learn to control aircrafts.
Because I can fly to anywhere I want to go.
For example, I can go to a desert island, savanna, or a place where no one has never been.
My nephew is learning to be a pilot in America.
I am jealous of him.
In addition, I guess that we can control a flying car in the future as same as driving a car now.
I hope to fly freely sometime.

I don't decide my career goal especially.
I just want to work comfortably and enjoyably.
I wouldn't particularly like to be a CEO, COO, or CFO something like that.
I would like to be happy with my family, my friends, and people around me.
However, I have my dream which I travel around the world.
I want to live in several countries.
I want to know a variety of culture there.
Especially local food, cause I'm foodie.
