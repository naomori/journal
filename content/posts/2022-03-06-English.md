# Review 2021/11/03 Modifying Comparison
Russian's invasion to Ukraine occurred two weeks ago.
Since then, the world has been totally changed and it is different from the previous one now.

Crimea in Ukraine was invaded by Russia eight years ago. At that time, the world was not as kind to Ukraine as today.
All presidents ignored the invasion, which was similar to agree with it.

If the world had expressed rejection for the invasion in the case of Crimea, Russia would not did it again this time.
Now, the whole world is nowhere near as certain as the previous one.
Russia is going to be much more isolated than before.

I'm afraid that this situations is getting much worse than now and it will be trigger of the 3rd World War.
We all learned from the previous world war that rejection against discrimination and respecting each other are keys to keep peace.
I wish that this horrible situation will be quit soon and we all are going to cooperate for peace.
