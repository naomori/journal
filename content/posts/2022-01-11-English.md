# Review 2021/09/01 Compare and Contrast

Lately, I study on weekdays as well as weekends.
Because I'd like to change my job, contrary to my colleagues.
My company is good for most employees like other Japanese traditional big companies.
On the other hand, I always feel frustration with the process of my company which is too slow to do anything.
I guess most of Japanese traditional companies are similar to my company.
So, I will change my circumstance this year.

Reality, Openness, Development, Slowly, Dangerous

Unfortunately, the fall of Japan economy has been turned out to be reality.
It's due to lack of openness on the Japanese market, I think.
It prevents Japan from improving development in many industries.
However, the dangerous which is coming to Japan is slowly, not rapidly.
That will more harm than good.
Because people will not be able to get a opportunity to make it better.
Many Japanese feel a sense of crisis under these circumstances, but they don't know how to recover.
