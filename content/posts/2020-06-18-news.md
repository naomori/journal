I've read the news below.

[Body Cameras Haven't Stopped Police Brutality. Here's Why](https://www.wired.com/story/body-cameras-stopped-police-brutality-george-floyd/)

I wonder why they did it under surveillance.
They certainly will be charged for violence if they did it,
because police has the evidence of the violence.
It's obvious. So, I'm interested in this article.

Six years ago, an 18-years-old black man was killed by police officer.
So then, everyone decided to equip police officers with body cameras.
They expected that the cameras will suppress the police officers violence.
But it turns out not to work.

Most police officers are just going out and doing their jobs,
they don't care about the body cameras.
Because by design, body-worn cameras point outwards into the world.
In addition, most people can't access the record movie of the cameras.
Even if there were police officers violence, the police haven't disclose all of them.
