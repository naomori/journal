# The day before depature
We decided to carry out our luggage by Sagawa Express to the Handea airport.
The luggage was to be carried by the carrier the day before.
Until the day I was very busy with packing.

That day I could not sleep much because of excitement.

# The depature day, at the airport
The plane we were to ride was at 11:35.
We wanted to arrive at the airport two hours ago,
so we left home at 7:30.

We were a little tired because the train was crowded by commuting,
but we were relatively comfortable
because we had our suitcases carried the day before.

We used a face-recognition departure gate at Haneda.
It's convenient because it's very easy and fast.

At the airport, we went around the duty free shop and
took a break at the lounge.

# The flight
The plane left on schedule.

The destination was the London Heathrow airport,
the estimated arrive time was 16:10, and the flight time was 12 hours.

I was looking forward to the trip, got excited, and
couldn't sleep at all in the plane.
