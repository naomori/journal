Today, I, my boss and the boss of my boss talked about my reassignment department.
In the end, we decided that I would work in a new department as a temp,
leaving my position behind in the current department.
This is because staff reassignment procedure takes one or two months.
I'd like to work in a new department as quickly as I can,
and also I don't care where my position is.

I heard of that the department I'd be reassigned works on a task related with machine learning.
I don't know about the details of the task,
but, I'm a little relieved to be able to work on a new task.
At the earliest, next week I'll work in the new department.

Thank gosh.
