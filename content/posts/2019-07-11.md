I've been studying a development environment for AI(ML/DL).
I haven't studied AI itself yet.
Despite that, there are too many things I don't know and
I have a lot to learn.

It feels so good to know what I didn't know.
There are many such moments since I started studying AI.

It feels so good to try new things at any age.
