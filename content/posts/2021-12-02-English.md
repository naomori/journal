## Example
The new work began yesterday.
The first meeting complete in a friendly atmosphere.
The person in charge explained me my task and mission.
It seems that he hopes that I would help him and fit the workplace immediately.
Subsequently, I received some documents that he asked me to read before the today's meeting.

I need to catch up with him as soon as possible.
I believe that I will be able to do that, however I need to be humble and show my enthusiastic to my work.
In addition, I must keep improving myself every day for changing my job without postponement.
