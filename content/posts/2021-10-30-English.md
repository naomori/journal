# Today
It's good Saturday.
I woke up at noon and had lunch.
After that, I went to shopping and then had my hair cut.
Because my hair had grown out and it was annoying, and it took time to dry my hair and it interfered surfing.
Now, my head is light due to hair cut.
It's convenient to dry my hair and surfing.
