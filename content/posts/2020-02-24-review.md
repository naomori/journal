At today's lesson, I learned about grammar of wishes and imaginary situations or events.
And I made some sentences with wishes and imaginary situations.
Furthermore, I started lesson B about dilemmas.
I made some sentences which have dilemmas, however I couldn't do well.
I usually don't feel dilemmas, I live simply every day, I guess.

Anyway, at the next lesson, I'm gonna continue to learn about dilemmas.
My homework is to make some sentences about my dilemmas.
