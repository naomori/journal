Today, my new laptop was arrived.
It's new xps13 which has a 13.4 inches display and Ice-Lake chip and
it's superior to my laptop which I bought three and half years ago.
I have felt little bit irritated about bad performance of my laptop,
so I ordered it April 14th.

At first, I don't think I can receive it today because DELL told me it will be arribed May 18th.
I think it's super late, though.
I wonder it will be late due to corona virus, and it's reasonable, I guess.
Fortunately, I could receive it today.

I'm going to install Linux OS into the new laptop removing Windows. 
I will definitely enjoy it.
