description = "Improving my English skill"
+++

I took an English conversation lesson,
it's the first time I came back from my honeymoon.

I have visited England, Scotland, Canada and America in my honeymoon,
so I thought that my English skill improve a little bit maybe,
but it's not at all.

I will study English harder than before so I can work abroad.
Of course, I want to enjoy studying English.
The proverb says, "what one likes, one will do well."
