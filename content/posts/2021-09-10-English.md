# Review 2021/09/10 Touchstone3 (ALEX)

I learned about adverbs of attitude.

As instance, certainly, clearly, frankly, fortunately, honestly,
hopefully, incredibly, naturally, obviously, really, simple, surprisingly, etc.

## Homework
I really like adventures.
I've positively tried several adventures so far, as instance, scuba diving, surfing, paragliding, zip lines, etc.
However I don't want to try some of adventures.
Frankly, I'm scared of bungee jumping and parachuting.
Because I don't believe the durability of the equipments honestly.
I know that you think I'm being overly sensitive about it.
On the other hand, everything is corrupted some day absolutely, and everyone makes an error definitely.
That is to say, I'm just clearly practical, not sensitive.
