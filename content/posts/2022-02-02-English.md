[Why Wagyu Beef Is So Expensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CTzhqVHmww)

## Takeaway from the video
I love beef.
Although I like chicken, pork and lamb, I think beef the best.
I like the way to eat especially with soy sauce and wasabi.
However, if anything, I prefer lean meat to buttery meat like Wagyu.
Because Wagyu meat is too buttery, so I feel it greasy.
Therefore, I usually use wasabi when I eat Wagyu beef.
Wasabi can blow the greasy away from Wagyu beef.
It's so tasty.

My wife was born in Miyazaki where is the most famous for producing Wagyu.
In addition, I was born in Mie where is the most famous for fattening father of Wagyu.
So, we'd been tasting Wagyu from childhood.
You are jealous of us, aren't you?
