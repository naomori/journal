# Today

It's sunny and warm today.
I went surfing this early morning.
I go surfing early morning for a few days.
Because it's for my health about physically and mentally.
When I do some exercise early morning, I'm comfortable all day long.
I got sunburned, so may face is a little red.
Don't worry, it isn't due to drinking beer.
