I, my wife and our friends went to the Gyoza restaurant in Kameari, Tokyo.
The restaurant are introduced many times in TV shows, and very famous in Chiba.
I've wanted to go there since two years ago and at last I went there today.

The gyoza restaurant is named "White gyoza".
This is because Mr.Paku started the restaurant, his name means "White" in Japanese.

The gyoza dumpling is famous for their cooking methods.
It's steamed while fried.
First, put the gyoza dumplings in a pan and add boiling water, and heat.
After a while, pour a lot of oil into the pan.
Continue heating until the water has evaporated completely.
Again, pour a lot of oil into the pan.
When the gyouza dumplings have turned golden brown, it's done.

We bought sandwiches as souvenirs at Yoshida Bakery.
It was really delicious.
