In the previous lesson,
I studied English words about various cooking methods.

The differences among grill, barbeque, bake, and roast are below.
* grill
  - to cook food using very strong heat directly above and below it.
* barbeque
  - to cook food on a metal frame over a charcoal fire outdoors
* roast
  - to cook food by prolonged exposure to heat in an oven
* bake
  - to cook potatoes, cakes or breads by dry heat in an oven
