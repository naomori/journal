# Today
I'm lazy today.
I woke up late at 10am this morning.
And then, I watched performances of Winter Olympic games on TV, figure skating and snowboard slope style.
Their performances are so beautiful and amazing.

After this class, I will go surfing.
I went surfing yesterday as well.
This weekend there are good waves to surf, and so I'm happy.

I don't care who wins the prize.
I just want to watch their fantastic performances.
