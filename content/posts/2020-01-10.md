At yesterday's lesson,
I learned to build sentences using common collocations with do, make, and etc.
In addition, I reviewed unit 4 to 6 through some exercises.
I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively.
I used too many times "and" as conjunctions, though.
I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.

At last I'll be transferred to new department.
I'm gonna work in the Cloud development team.
I don't have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.
I'm gonna move to the department next to the previous one.
I'm relieved to be able to work in the department which I'm interested in.

I should enjoy to work and become happy, I think.
I hate to refrain from stress.
It wastes my life.

Now, I'll do my best in new department and I can be happy.
