      <description>The pleasure of summer vacation My family used to go to Nagashima Resort in the summer, when I was a kid. Back then, I was always looking forward to going Nagashima Resort every summer. Both now and then, Nagashima Resort is the biggest amusement park in Kansai region; it has a tremendous pool, various water slides and roller coasters.
Nowadays, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to an Amusement park. I don&amp;rsquo;t like going crowded places these days because I get tired.</description>

      <description>Today, I worked at the office. This week, the progress of my work isn&amp;rsquo;t so good, because what I tried to end this week didn&amp;rsquo;t end. The reason is the lack of understanding machine learning.
I wanted to start training my machine learning model this week. I cannot start it tomorrow probably. Definitely. It can&amp;rsquo;t be helped. Next week I&amp;rsquo;ll try.
Last weekend typhoon no.19 came, however, I had no damage.</description>

      <description>Unit 4: Family life Lesson D: Family activities 1. Reading A. Yes, we did. I and my family used to eat together every dinner. We used to talk about what we did and how we feel. Plus, we used to talk about neighbours, friends, relatives, and TV show, movies, everything.
B: Why does Barbara think families should eat together more often? Because children who have regular meals with their families feel less stressed, have a healthier weight, get better grades, and are less likely to get into trouble than children from families that don&amp;rsquo;t eat together.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling well recently. I have a runny nose and lots of sneeze, and I&amp;rsquo;m dull. I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably because of air conditioning during sleep.
However, I can&amp;rsquo;t stop the air conditioner while sleeping. If I do that, I will get heat stroke.</description>

      <description>I and my wife went to Kurumaya in Fujisawa. Kurumaya had a special service for summer only. Yukata and japanese cuisine were included in the set, and the Kimono teacher dressed us in yukata. In addition, a professional photographer took a picture of us.
The meal was very delicious. We will definitely be there next year.</description>

Well, yesterday, she went hang-gliding. She said she was really scared.
Was she? I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised. You know Suzanne. She&amp;rsquo;s always been scared of trying anything new.

      <description>The surgery began at 9:00 am. The surgery was scheduled to end in 6 to 8 hours, but it took 11 hours. The doctor who mainly operated the surgery told us that the bleeding didn&amp;rsquo;t stop for a while and he hesitated to continue operating. Fortunately, the bleeding stopped and he continued. That is the reason that it took long time.
Moreover, he said that this cancer might have metastasized to the liver.</description>

I had been camping in Hyuga that summer, and a typhoon came. The typhoon passed near my campsite in the middle of the night and left to the east. In the early morning of the next day, the wind calmed and the big wave remained.</description>

      <description>I have been running along the Kugenuma coast. That was the first time in a month. It was very humid and hot, but it was nice to run along the seafront at night.
On the sandy beach, the construction of a sea house was being promoted at night, and I felt the arrival of summer.</description>

      <description>I was thinking of surfing today as I did yesterday. So I went to surf. But, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t surf, I was almost drown.
The low pressure made strong onshore winds and high waves, making it difficult for me to surf. They disturbed me trying to go outside.
The wind was weak early in the morning, so I wish I had gone surfing at that time.
In the afternoon, I watched a drama broadcasted on NETFLIX.</description>

      <description>Today, I went out for drinking with my wife and friends in Noge, Yokohama. It was drizzling rain, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad it didn&amp;rsquo;t rain heavily.
We went to three Izakaya bars. In Noge, there are many Izakaya bars, so people go to some Izakaya bars to enjoy various dishes and drinks.
One of our friends traveled to Spain for a week in early June. She gave us some presents. We were very happy.</description>

      <description>I worked from home today. I had written documents for my software about its architecture, usage, how to build and installation.
The reason what I worked from home today was that the typhoon was supposed to come. But it went to somewhere. There were no winds, no heavy rain and no lightning.
The weather was so fine and hot today. It&amp;rsquo;s a season that requires air conditioning.
I will go surfing tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Today is sunny weather during the rainy season. The air temperature is high and humidity is also high, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s better than a rainy day.
Apart from that, Zozomat was announced. It measures your foot shape three-dimensionally in millimeters.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great innovation because I have had several mistakes in selecting shoes. It will be delivered this winter, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it.</description>

      <description>Today, I spent a depraved day. I watched anime all day long. It was One punch man.
This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.</description>

      <description>On Father&amp;rsquo;s day, my family ate eel. I love eels very much. Eel is just awesome.
Sadly, however, the number of eels has been decreasing. It&amp;rsquo;s said that the reasons are overfishing and environmental change.
Since the ecology of eels isn&amp;rsquo;t known yet, complete eel farming is difficult.
Even now, research on complete eel farming is being continued, and it is said that it may be successful with a little more.</description>

It was last December. He didn&amp;rsquo;t inform his daughter that he had surgery so as not to make her worry.</description>

Keynote (10:00-11:30) It was the almost same as the Day 1&amp;rsquo;s keynote. Furthermore, the presenter talked too much and it was overtime. Panasonic&amp;rsquo;s speech wasn&amp;rsquo;t good neither.

      <description>Today I watched Friends after a long time, because I thought that I could learn daily conversation by wathing this movie.
In NETFLIX, I can download its movies, so I can watch them during commuting.
To learn daily conversation, I will watch it twice each time. The first time, I watch it in Japanese with English caption to know what each its quotes mean. The second time, I watch it in English with English caption, so I learn pronunciation and expressions in English.</description>

NETFLIX is free for the first month, so during the period I will try to find out if NETFLIX is useful to studying English.
I like movies very much, so &amp;ldquo;what one likes, one will do well.</description>

I rode waves only a few times, and wiped out many times. The sea is fairly cold that I might caught a bit cold. Still, I enjoyed surfing very much and I will keep surfing.</description>

      <description>AWS DeepRace League - Technical Workdshop Yesterday, I joined the &amp;ldquo;AWS Deep Racer League - Technical Workhop&amp;rdquo;, because I wanted to have fun learning about machine learning. The AWS DeepRacer is a 1&amp;frasl;18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&amp;rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It&amp;rsquo;s the Softech&amp;rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7&amp;rsquo;0&amp;rdquo;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How to build your confidence - and spark it others&amp;rdquo; I lose my confidence when I fail and disappointed myself,
when I was given cold stares, when I was blamed, and
when I was ignored.
This TED talk, Ms. Brittany Packnett&amp;rsquo;s speech, gives me a confidence.
It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.
Impressed words  Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it.</description>

      <description>Today, we went to Buckingham Palace to see changing of the guard. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that before on TV. There was crowded so much. A lot of tourists came to see that like us. We saw changing the guard, they were like toy soldiers. After that, we went to British Museum to see Rosetta Stone. I was very impressed because it was the key to solving the mysteries of ancient Egypt. </description>

      <description>Take a walk in London We had a little bit jet lag, so we were going to relax and take a walk in London. And we&amp;rsquo;d like to buy gifts in return.
London is a huge and advanced city, however, London has buildings from the Middle Ages. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing and attractive city.
Shopping We haven&amp;rsquo;t decided what to buy as gifts yet, so we were going to go window-shopping at Soho and Regent Street.</description>

      <description>Immigration I got a little bit nervous at immigration, because I usually get asked many questions at the immigration examination and I can&amp;rsquo;t answer well.
This time, however, immigration officers are very kind. Moreover, my wife said &amp;ldquo;This is our honeymoon&amp;rdquo; then, they said to us &amp;ldquo;Conguraturations!&amp;rdquo; with smile.
Tube We went to the center of London city by Tube: it&amp;rsquo;s subway in London. To ride Tube, we bought Oyster card at the station.</description>
