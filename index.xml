Because it sometime had some water drops from its duct. So, I called to real estate management company of my apartment and she said to me that they&amp;rsquo;ll fix it.
Anyway, I appreciated it. New air conditioner is clean and powerful. It cools down my room quickly than before.</description>

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk well in English at the today&amp;rsquo;s lesson. I can&amp;rsquo;t find my words and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;ldquo;let me see,&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and so on during thinking. While I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about what I should say or what I want to say, I ought to say something to connect between conversation. I have no idea about that.
So, I read this below.

      <description>Yesterday, I cooked Takoyaki again. I actually failed to cook Takoyaki a week ago, however I failed it. Because I mixed mashed yamaimo yam with Takoyaki dough, so that the dough was sticky. I fried it with Takoyaki pan, but it sticked with the pan and was burned. I was so frustrated with it, so I tried it again yesterday.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t mix mashed Yamaimo yam with Takoyaki dough this time, because I have learned it.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s super expensive, about 400,000-500,000 yen. On the other hand, when you build them yourself, it&amp;rsquo;s cheeper to build them than buy it. So, I&amp;rsquo;m decided to build them. Because I&amp;rsquo;m unsatisfied with the performance of my laptop. Since I work from home, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my laptop for handling with huge data, such as images.</description>

We are taught that anger is born from aggression, and destructive. But if we moderate it and direct it the right way, don&amp;rsquo;t you think it can be good for us?
The Roman philosopher described anger as a “short madness” that sets us on the path to self-destruction. He said that it was fundamentally wicked and it damaged human race than any diseases.</description>

      <description>This week, I was trying to train a model which recognize human faces and vehicle registration plates. However, I have a problem that the it needs more CPU power to train a model. It&amp;rsquo;s a practical problem. So I decided to use Google Colaboratory to use more CPU and GPU/TPU to compute faster. Although, I have another problem about a storage to hold a dataset for training the model. The problem is that Google Colaboratory can&amp;rsquo;t have much storage, therefore I want to use Amazon S3 and tried it, but it&amp;rsquo;s too slow to read.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, I tried my new surfboard. In short, it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing surfboard. I could take off earlier than my shorter surfboard as well as more enjoyable. Because I could get more pushing power from waves and also feel like wave is softer than before. Maybe the surfboard is bigger and heavier than my other surfboard. On the other hand, I little worried about that it&amp;rsquo;s little bit more difficult to ride surfboard with single fin.</description>

When there is high waves, I have to dive under waves but it&amp;rsquo;s tough to use middle length board.</description>

It must be a winter and it must not a tropical place there. She might be a ski player or a ice skater. Because she&amp;rsquo;s training on snow field. Otherwise, she might be a trail runner. A marathon runner can&amp;rsquo;t be training on snow field.
She must be feeling sad in a shoping mall.</description>

      <description>I had a class of English Speaking up just now. And the teacher suggested me a web site which helps me measure my English skill. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Test Your Vocab&amp;rdquo;. I did it, and my score is 6,370 words. It can be enough to make a small talk in ordinary life, however I can&amp;rsquo;t. Because it&amp;rsquo;s just a number of words I can read, not speak. I should get more words I can use in having conversations.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read the new below. Because Coronavirus social-contact curbs effect also adults, not only adolescents, I think.
 Coronavirus social-contact curbs &amp;lsquo;put adolescents at risk&amp;rsquo;  Scientists define adolescence as between 10 and 24 and regard them as a vulnerable stage to prepare for adult life. Because it&amp;rsquo;s key time for the development of the brain and it&amp;rsquo;s also the period in life when mental-health problems are likely to develop.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning English at English school for about a year. I want to improve my English more, however I sometimes can&amp;rsquo;t listen to what my teacher said, and even if I can, I can&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly.
In these days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading some news and summarizing it. And I give a short speech about it in my class. Although, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember all of the speech, so I can&amp;rsquo;t give a speech well, I read it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article below. Because I love seafood, but I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what the vegan seafood is. So, I&amp;rsquo;m insterested in this article.
Vegan seafood: The next plant-based meat trend?
Seafood is difficult to veganise well, but some companies are betting on new technologies and customers to overcome the challenges.
There are various imitation fish dishes now - fish and chips, eels, canned tuna. Faux seafood isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely new, but products are limited and many of those that have been available so far have been underwhelming and under-marketed.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I talked about Silicon Valley and Annihilation. And I answered the questions about reviews and comments for AVATAR. I summarized a conversation about Cirque du Soleil show between Jim and Marissa.
I have a homework. I have to write a review about concert, a show, a movie, or a book I&amp;rsquo;ve seen or read.
Actually, in today&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I talked just about surfing, news and movies. So, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go forward on textbook well.</description>

      <description>I watched a film, &amp;ldquo;Annihilation&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a science fiction horror film. It was released theatricaly in 2018, but it became a box office bomb. And then it was released digitally by Netflix. You can watch it now on Netflix.
Natalie Portman plays a biologist who entered &amp;ldquo;The Shimmer&amp;rdquo;, which is a mysterious quarantined zone of mutating plants and animals caused by an alien presence. The Shimmer emerged three years prior from a meteor that landed in a lighthouse, and gradually expanding and increasing its boundaries.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read this news below. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve worked from home since pandemic started. I hate working at office due to a small desk, a cheap chair, and narrow Internet bandwidth. And of course, I hate also commutes itself.
Silicon Valley Rethinks the (Home) Office
Tech companies have lured talent with sweet in-office perks: lavish lunch buffets, beer and wine on tap, and something like that. But now, the pandemic has shuffled employees out of the office and into their own homes.</description>

      <description>Rainy season is coming. It comes 3 week earlier than usual year. Also mosquitoes is coming. I hate both. I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep at all hot and humid night with flying mosquitoes near my ears. It&amp;rsquo;s too irritating to keep sane.
So, I bought an insect repellant and insect killer at Costco in Zama city. Zama is little bit closer than Yokohama from Fujisawa. There was fewer people than usual at Costco.</description>

PREP In short, the article said that risks make us, even risk-avoider of us, rise a challenge.
Emotion and perspective get in the way of our risk assessments.</description>

      <description>I studied about favors at work. I summarized conversations between people and their boss. And I practiced role play, a person and his boss or colleagues.
However, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t summarize conversations well. My teacher told me that I should care about 4W1H: &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;where&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;when&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;who&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;how&amp;rsquo;.

      <description>Just like yesterday, I went to surfing after work. It was windy, so surface of the sea was bumpy and it was little difficult to ride waves.
In these days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying knee-riding, which is way to ride on my knees on a surfboard. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to ride waves and I can enjoy to feel more waves. However, it isn&amp;rsquo;t a commonly way to ride waves. I know that.</description>

Why do we feel uneasy about a ‘new normal’?
Stay-at-home orders are starting to life and many people are returning to work. But why do we feel anxious about returning our usual routines?
During lockdown, we&amp;rsquo;ve daydreamed about the return to normal life, however we are facing a puzzling dilemma. We feel anxious about resuming our normal routines, even though they&amp;rsquo;re precisely what we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to.</description>

      <description>I went to surfing this afternoon and evening. I enjoyed surfing from 5:30pm until little after 7:00pm. The days are getting longer in these days, so I can enjoy surfing a lot than before. It&amp;rsquo;s very good surfing after work. I feel tiring from work has gone. Actually I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted after surfing, though.
Anyway, since I started to work from home, I have time to free than before. So, I can enjoy everyday without stress from commuting.</description>

      <description>At yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about how to use &amp;lsquo;already&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;still&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;yet&amp;rsquo; with present perfect. At beginning of the lesson, I talked about the article which I&amp;rsquo;ve read, however I couldn&amp;rsquo;t explain it well. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t summarize it well and couldn&amp;rsquo;t deliver my opinion clearly and smoothly. Because I didn&amp;rsquo;t organize my opinion about it. I&amp;rsquo;ve read news carefully with looking up words I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, so far. But it&amp;rsquo;s not good to understand articles and practice conversation, I guess.</description>

      <description>Unit-10: What&amp;rsquo;s up? Lesson.B: Movies 1. Building vocabulary Delicatessen It&amp;rsquo;s a black comedy film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro. Jean-Pierre Jeunet directed The City of Lost Children, Alien 2 Resurrection, and Amelie. Dominique Pinon plays a major character in the movie. He played in Alien 4 and in mostly Jean-Pierre Jeunet&amp;rsquo;s film.
I saw it when I was in a junior high school. At that time, I was a movie freak, so I used to go to rental video shop and borrowed 2 or 3 video tape every weekends.</description>

      <description>It seemed that there was crowded around Enoshima-Island due to tourist. Everybody can&amp;rsquo;t stand self-quarantine any more, I guess. So, I avoided going to the beach due to infection with corona virus in the morning and around noon. I went surfing just before sunset. It was good saves to surf in the morning rather than around sunset, however, there was few surfers rather than morning, so that I could enjoy surfing much.</description>

      <description>I had my teeth clean at dental clinic in the morning. I have been going to dental clinic to remove dental stone from my teeth every 2 or 3 months. Because teeth care and eye care are most important factors for quality of life. I want to trip all over the world and enjoy local speciality meals there, I want to see beautiful views and historical spot.
Moreover, physical fitness is also important.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I learned kinds of movies and how to explain movies.
 It&amp;rsquo;s a kinds of movies.  It&amp;rsquo;s about main story of the movie. It&amp;rsquo;s funny or something ajective.   It&amp;rsquo;s set in something era or century.  Someone actor is in it. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of violent or some thing ajective, though.   It&amp;rsquo;s take plain in somewhere. Someone actor plays something role who does something.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about change of way of thinking about my life.
 Japan&amp;rsquo;s formula for life satisfaction  Ikigai means what it’s something you live for.
So far, or even now Japanese traditional companies valued not only company loyalty but input factors such as time and effort rather than output factors like results or progress. Long hours and sacrificed leisure time were (and still are) seen as positive virtues, while the “ganbaru” trait – meaning “trying hard” – is valued above all.</description>

 Climate change: Could the coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery?  The drop in traffic due to corona virus is a major contributor to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed globally. Most people think climate change is as serious as coronavirus.
So, people will try to avoid using public transport system for fear of infection, and a plan of building road will be quit.</description>

About four months ago, my friend contacted me via facebook messenger. He is a friend when we were in a graduate school. He said &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you have a reunion with our laboratory&amp;rsquo;s member?&amp;rdquo;. I agreed with that and I asked him to invite other members.</description>

There is nothing for it but to avoid infecting with corona virus and study English at home. I&amp;rsquo;ll think about improving my English and technical skill during this holidays.

From tomorrow, my holidays are gonna start. However, unfortunately I can&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere due to corona virus. Most shops and restaurants are closed, and the local people might not welcome people who come from other places, because of suppressing infection of corona virus.
Now, very gloomy atmosphere is sweeping over Japan.</description>

I have felt little bit irritated about bad performance of my laptop, so I ordered it April 14th.
At first, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can receive it today because DELL told me it will be arribed May 18th. I think it&amp;rsquo;s super late, though.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll make sentences using vocabularies I&amp;rsquo;ve learned at the last lesson, privately, publicly, scam, cheating, trick, &amp;lsquo;when it comes to&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;, and hold onto.
Outbreak of Corona virus in Japan is less terrible than other countries, the one of the reasons is that Japanese people don&amp;rsquo;t hug, shake hands, and cheek kiss privately. In addition, another reason is that Japanese people wear a mask and don&amp;rsquo;t speak much in the train, buses, and elevators publicly.</description>

      <description>Due to COVID-19, every countries&#39; government have started lockdown. On the other hand, Japan government hasn&amp;rsquo;t started lockdown. Why?
The reason is that Japanese constitution don&amp;rsquo;t have the Act, like Emergency Powers Act in U.K or National Emergency Act in U.S.A. So, Japan rockdown can&amp;rsquo;t be done. The Act has power to restrict private rights for moving, shopping, business activities, like that. It&amp;rsquo;s useful for helping people under severe situations like terrible earthquakes, hurricanes or disease like this COVID-19.</description>

      <description>Also today, I worked from home. I did some stretching exercises this morning and yesterday&amp;rsquo;s morning after waking up. Then, I can get through the day comfortably. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to do stretching after waking up.
I had an English lesson yesterday. It was a remote lesson via zoom, video call. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to have a remote lesson, I think. However I&amp;rsquo;ll have a offline lesson if I can. There is a good point on a offline lesson, that is I can see a teacher&amp;rsquo;s mouth behavior and hear clear pronunciation.</description>

      <description>The peak of technology I think that the peak of technology is cyber-brain and full-body prosthesis. A cyber-brain allows people to interface their biological brain with various networks. A fully prosthetic body makes a person become a cyborg.
A cyber-brain can improve the Human-Machine interface amazingly, it can allow people to access machines and data super easily like thinking. The current human-Machine interface devices, like a keyboard, a mouse, a touch pad and screen, or voice commands, are really not kind to people.</description>

      <description>In the morning, I went surfing for the first time in a while. Because I bought a bodyboard and wanted to try it. Fortunately, there were good waves to surf. Unfortunately, I lost my right foot swim-fin. When I tried to ride a big wave and I caught it, however, on the contrary the wave caught me and swallowed me. I was swallowed, upside down, round and round. When I floated to the surface of the sea, I realized that my right swim-fin had gone.</description>

Kids need to know how to use them. You know what I&amp;rsquo;m saying? Maybe, on the other hand, they can be distracting. So, school should set internet filter like parental control.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think you can listen to music and study at the same time.</description>

In these days, I just work and jog. But in rainy day I can&amp;rsquo;t jog, it would be nice if there were enough waves to surf at least.</description>

If you register your google calendar into it, you can see your schedule on Alexa which has a display, or you can know your schedule when you ask Alexa.</description>

I had a English lesson via video call for the first time. At first, I&amp;rsquo;ve got bewildered in unfamiliar remote lesson. However, several minutes later I got used to getting a remote lesson.
It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes noisy and unclear at a remote lesson, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good experience for a phone interview to change my job, I think.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry for his death. He is the greatest and most loved comedian in Japan. I used to watch his comedy show every Saturday when I was a child. I think half of Japanese people watched his show at that time, especially kids including me loved him. I genuinely pray that his soul may rest in peace.
His death will save many Japanese, I guess. So far, many Japanese might think &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m OK.</description>

It seems to me that they take for granted that I do research and told them gently what they can&amp;rsquo;t understand. They think the reason they don&amp;rsquo;t understand is because I don&amp;rsquo;t explain to them, I guess.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I and my teacher cleared my goals of learning English in Cebu.
My goals are, firstly, to speak general English smoothly, frequently, and naturally. Because I want to enjoy small talks with people who I meet in trip. If I could do that, I could have new idea and thought to enjoy my life through their culture, history, custom, and etc.
Secondary is to get a job abroad, like the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, or New Zealand, and so on.</description>

      <description>I worked from home today. It&amp;rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus, of course. Forty percents of employee in my office work from home. Rest of them have to work at the office because they should handle specific hardware there. And unfortunately, IT department in my office didn&amp;rsquo;t suppose that so many employees connect from home to the office at the same time so that it was hard to connect from home to the office network.</description>

      <description>I went surfing in the evening and then I had a dinner. I used to watch TV or movie after dinner. However I was exhausted due to surfing, so I went to bed soon. It was about at nine or ten.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I don&amp;rsquo;t sleep well after I was exhausted. I woke up at 3:00 am and couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep since then. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I will be sleepy today.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about dilemmas and some verbs + prepositions. Dilemma means a situation in which it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to decide what to do, because all the choices seem equally good or equally bad. Longman dictionary says that. I answered questions which have dilemmas.
And today, I worked from home all day. It&amp;rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.</description>

      <description>At today&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about grammar of wishes and imaginary situations or events. And I made some sentences with wishes and imaginary situations. Furthermore, I started lesson B about dilemmas. I made some sentences which have dilemmas, however I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do well.

Anyway, at the next lesson, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna continue to learn about dilemmas. My homework is to make some sentences about my dilemmas.</description>

      <description>At last lesson, my teacher Cathy said that I have to research about Zen and I have to tell her what is Zen and how to do Zen. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to explain about Zen, I think. Because Zen is one of religions, so it must be complicated and confusing. At first, I searched Zen by Google.
Zen is one of training of Zenshu. Zenshu is one sect of Buddhism, and the goal of Zenshu is to attain spiritual enlightenment.</description>

Some people says it&amp;rsquo;s too much to worry about. Yeah, I know. But, my wife is weak, so it will be a problem if she is infected with corona virus. Because corona virus kills people who have a health problem.
I wish that corona virus doesn&amp;rsquo;t spread any more.</description>

What questions can you ask a new friend about these topics?  School or work  What are you studying? What do you do? What&amp;rsquo;s your job? Are you a graduated student? Are you a mad scientist?   Home and family  How many siblings do you have?</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I learned to soften comments and make sentences using those phrases. And I tried to continue speaking for one minute about something theme.
I sometimes couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my words, however, I almost could continue speaking. It was prepared theme in advance, not free theme, though. My teacher, Cathay said that I prepared every lessons in advance and it was good, but I prepared too much, though. She meant that I only studied a few situations that the book described.</description>

      <description>I learned softening comments using &amp;ldquo;I think&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;a little bit&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;maybe&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;kind of&amp;rdquo;, etc. In addition, I made some sentences with those expressions to soften. I mostly made it, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly, though.
I&amp;rsquo;ll practice more and more.</description>

      <description>Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.C: She&amp;rsquo;s just a bit odd. 1. Conversation strategy: Softening comments A. What are your neighbors like? Do you get along with them? Tell the class. My neighbors next door are a man and his daughter. It seems to me that they get along well, because I sometimes see they&amp;rsquo;re talking with smile. But late at night once or twice, I heard him to shout like being drunk, so I&amp;rsquo;m bit worried about it.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I practiced to continue speaking for one minute. In addition, I practiced to use some common phrasal verbs and various conjunctions. It was difficult to build my opinion, and use phrasal verbs and various conjunctions at the same time. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any words and use those phrasal verbs and conjunctions very much.
On the other hand, the phrasal verbs and various conjunctions like those are important to casual conversation.</description>

      <description>Before starting Lesson C. I will do homework about Lesson B.
Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B, Section.2 A.7-9 7. First dates usually turn out to be a disaster! I agree with that partially. Not usually, sometimes it turns out to be a disaster. Because someone who don&amp;rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&amp;rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&amp;rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&amp;rsquo;t like.</description>

I had wrist-ache. I don&amp;rsquo;t the reason, but I have been typed a keyboard too much, I think. It&amp;rsquo;s painful even if I do nothing. I hope that it&amp;rsquo;s cured soon.</description>

      <description>I learned some vocabularies and grammars about dating. And I learned some phrasal verbs like get along, go out, break up and so on.
In addition, I learned elope and burn bridge. &amp;ldquo;Elope&amp;rdquo; means to leave from your home to get married even though your parents don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to do that. And &amp;ldquo;burn bridge&amp;rdquo; means that you can&amp;rsquo;t get back once you&amp;rsquo;ve done that.
I tried to speak for one minute about anything, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B: Dating 1. Building vocabulary and grammar A. High school sweethearts I have some questions about vocabularies.
&amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;work out&amp;rdquo; emphasizes this expression? If this statement doesn&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo;, does it have the same meanings?
What does &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; mean? I think that there is an inconsistency between &amp;ldquo;they are now living&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo;. Because &amp;ldquo;they are now living&amp;rdquo; means the current and &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; means the future.</description>

      <description>I have been really sleepy today. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep well last night, because I did exercise too much for the first time in three weeks, I think.
Yesterday, I went jogging for an hour at the seaside, and I walked for two hours to play game, Dragon Quest walk, kind of Pokemon go. I was too tired so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have enough sleep.
The reason that I did too much exercise is the&amp;hellip; No special reason.</description>

      <description>This weekend was relaxing days. I went to the city library and borrowed a book, the title is &amp;ldquo;Talking to My Daughter About the Economy.&amp;rdquo;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t read it yet.
After that I went to shopping at near super market and bought lots of food and drink. Because I had a trip to Aomori two weekends ago, so that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go to shopping.
In addition, I run at the seaside for about 1 hour, 10 kilo meters.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I reviewed Unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. It&amp;rsquo;s about ways to talk about the future and food. Again I tried to get off the phone, I didn&amp;rsquo;t do well though. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t end the conversation smoothly and naturally.
I finished Unit 4 to 6 at last, so next lesson, I&amp;rsquo;m going to begin Unit 7 about relationships. I&amp;rsquo;m little worried whether I can do well, because I&amp;rsquo;m introverted.</description>

      <description>I and my wife enjoyed a 3-days trip in Aomori last weekend. We traveled by train. I have never taken the Tohoku shinkansen until this time. I was looking forward to a train lunch box in the Tohoku shinkansen. Unfortunately, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t sold in the train. I don&amp;rsquo;t why it wasn&amp;rsquo;t, however, I was disappointed with that. Probably, Tokyo lunch box isn&amp;rsquo;t popular very much.
Day 1, after four and half hours train, we arrived in Aomori at 1:00 pm.</description>

      <description>At yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned to build sentences using common collocations with do, make, and etc. In addition, I reviewed unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively. I used too many times &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; as conjunctions, though. I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.
At last I&amp;rsquo;ll be transferred to new department. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.</description>

      <description>Today is my wife&amp;rsquo;s birthday. I presented fluffy pajamas, champagne and a champagne glass to her. She was very pleased and I was glad to see that. The fluffy pajamas was Gelato pique&amp;rsquo;s one that she&amp;rsquo;s been wanted before. Champagne was Veuve Clicquot that is the one of her favorite. And the champagne glass was Riedel&amp;rsquo;s one. Riedel&amp;rsquo;s glass makes a difference in taste of wine.
Even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t a wine expert, you can feel the difference between normal glass and Riedel&amp;rsquo;s one.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I answered a question whose the person couldn&amp;rsquo;t have time to listen to recordings of his lectures. My advice was taking notes of his lectures, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take time rather than listening to the recordings.
And I learned the meanings of &amp;ldquo;on the good side&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;undecided&amp;rdquo;. And &amp;ldquo;make a difference&amp;rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &amp;ldquo;make a &amp;lsquo;some adjective&amp;rsquo; impression&amp;rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.</description>

Answer You can&amp;rsquo;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.</description>

Unfortunately, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the sunrise and Mt.Fuji on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day because of thick cloud. Today we ate Zouni as brunch. My wife cooked Hakata Zouni which is localized in Hakata region. It contains Mochi, Katsuona(a kind of leaf mustard), Buri(a yellowtail fish), and etc. It&amp;rsquo;s really tasty, I like it.</description>

We Japanese wish healthful long life and eat it on new year&amp;rsquo;s eve. The long soba noodles symbolize a long life. The buckwheat plant can survive severe weather during growing period, so that soba represents strength and resiliency.
After lunch, I went surfing. There were fine waves and I enjoyed.</description>

I went to America on my way of honeymoon. I wanted to introduce my wife to my brother&amp;rsquo;s family. And I&amp;rsquo;d like to eat American and Canadian foods, and see the Niagara falls again.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been there with my dad and mom three years ago. It was an amazing experience, but it was not enough to visit there only once.</description>

I started to work with a new team that was developing applications of IoT and Cloud. If I can use and manage kubernetes and docker smoothly, I think if I can make a contribute to the team, I can transfer to the team.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s lesson was the final English lesson this year. I started to study English conversation lesson this March, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel improving my English skill so much.
I think that I ought to study English everyday. Everyday. Christmas and New year&amp;rsquo;s days are no exception. If I really want to learn English conversation and work abroad or at a japan branch of foreign distribution company, I must study English everyday.</description>

      <description>1.C. Deliver your experience and ask your partner about her experience using the phrases. 1. &amp;ldquo;play a trick on&amp;rdquo; original question: Have you played a trick on someone? How did it turn out?
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time when I played a trick on someone. Well, when I was a child, I and my friends were going back home from elementary school.
I caught a small frog and put it on the shoulder of my friend without being noticed.</description>

      <description>Today I went to another ophthalmic clinic.
Two weeks ago, I went to a ophthalmic clinic, because I see a small circle for an instant in my right eye when I blink. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of shadow that I see after I see a bright small light. I was worried about my eyes, however, the doctor couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the reason. The doctor said, &amp;ldquo;There is no problem now, come again a month later&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I practiced delivering my experience and making a question. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly, and I took time to deliver my experience. It was difficult to organize thoughts first before delivering. I felt I had to respond quickly, on the contrary I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my words. Or I found only meaning less words.
Calm down, chill out, take it easy, Naoki. Nobody blame you. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to feel nervous.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I practiced Unit.6 Free talk again. And I read the blog and summarized it.
At the previous lesson, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep discussing about a community event. This time I did. I was relieved to be able to do that. I was a bit nervous before the last lesson. But I did and I got a bit confidence about English conversation.</description>

      <description>Today, I worked for the Cloud development team for the first time. The task what I did was connecting PlayStation 4 controller with Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and confirm the buttons which you pressed on the controller. It was so easy, but I was pleased with helping them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got to make up my mind what I should do in the Cloud development team. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about building the development and operating environment of Machine-Learning with AWS and Jetson Nano.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s homework. At the last lesson, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk smoothly about the community event. So that It&amp;rsquo;s my homework.
Who&amp;rsquo;s going to do what? 1. When is the event going to be? Where? What time? We&amp;rsquo;d better hold the event during summer vacation. Because adults can take day-off easily.
We might want to hold the event from 5pm to 8pm. Because children had better sleep early, not staying up late at night.</description>

We decided that I join the Cloud Development team temporary. For a while, I&amp;rsquo;ll work at the team and we&amp;rsquo;ll decide that I join the team officially.
I felt that the boss of the team is nice guy and the team members too, it&amp;rsquo;s a good team.</description>

      <description>Last Saturday, I went to a dental clinic, not for cleaning. It&amp;rsquo;s for making mouthpiece. I sometimes grind my teeth while sleeping. It&amp;rsquo;s for preventing from that. Cathy said that in Philippines we slap the person who grinds teeth in a sleep. Oh, my gosh. I won&amp;rsquo;t tell that to my wife.
And I went to a ophthalmic clinic for the first time. I have never been to a ophthalmic clinic, because I have good eyes.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s English lesson, I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event. I tried that, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do well at all. I think, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time. I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English. So, I can&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly in English about a theme which I&amp;rsquo;ve never think about. I&amp;rsquo;ve read books about how to study English before.</description>

At the next lesson, we&amp;rsquo;ve got to have some role-play phone conversations, so that I have to think about some situations.
And, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to use phrases below.
 I&amp;rsquo;d better go. I&amp;rsquo;ve got to get going. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to run. Can I call you back? I&amp;rsquo;ll call you later.</description>

      <description>Touchstone-3 Unit-6: Managing life Lesson D: Less is more 1. Reading A. Do you ever multitask? What kinds of things do you do at the same time? Is multitasking a good thing to do? About 20 years ago, when I was at network operation team in the previous company, I sometimes did multitask.
When I was in a network trouble, I&amp;rsquo;ve done multitask. It was calling customer, solving the problems, writing the report, asking my colleague to help me by a chat tool, and explaining that to my boss at the same time.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson.
I learned about the difference between assertive and aggressive. Assertive means that you are confident and say clearly what you think or what you want without attacking someone. It&amp;rsquo;s polite and positive. Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly, but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.
And, I learned about phone conversation. When you call someone, first, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc. Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.</description>

I ate Caesar salad, bean sprouts salad, Caprese, Lotus root tempura, lamb stew and Matsumae-Zuke, and drank tasty sake. The sake was brewed by Kumazawa brewery that is located in Fujisawa City. I like the sake of Kumazawa brewery and often buy it.
Yesterday, my wife was day-off and she likes cooking, so that she cooked too much.</description>

The dental clinic is a 5 minutes away by bicycle. So, I had to get ready to go out in 20 minutes.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&amp;rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&amp;rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.</description>

      <description>At the last weekend, I went to the dental clinic. It was the fourth time cleaning. The rest is two times. In addition, I had my mouth shaped to make a mouthpiece. Because I sometimes grind my teeth while sleeping. If I use it, I can prevent teeth grinding.
And I went to Costco, American big supermarket. I bought a lot, and salted herring roe. It is often put in New Year dishes.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, at the English conversation lesson, I learned about grammar for advisable, necessary, and preferable.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t speak smoothly at all. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my words and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say what I wanted to say. The teacher told me to speak a lot and not to overthink, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I should say. What do I have to do to speak a lot and smoothly, not to overthink? How do I study English to do that?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling good very much, today. Because I had a cold the day before yesterday. I had lots of coughs and sneezes. So, yesterday I took a morning day-off and went to a clinic to get a cold medicine. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve got better, but not perfect.
The reason which I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a whole day-off yesterday was that I was going to have to have a meeting with a boss of other department related with Machine Learning.</description>

I wanted to take a day-off today, but I was going to have to have a meeting with a boss of new department. The meeting wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I expected. He just introduced his department. I expected to talk about my task and its schedule with the boss.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I learned problems and solutions, and I remembered some vocabularies. For example, do the math. You use &amp;ldquo;do the math&amp;rdquo;, when you do easy addition or subtraction. On the other hand, you use &amp;ldquo;calculate&amp;rdquo;, when you use a numerical expression.
And newly wed. It&amp;rsquo;s me. It means a person who got married recently. I told my teacher that I&amp;rsquo;ve got married this March and when and where I and my wife met for the first time, so she said to me, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a newly wed!</description>

      <description>I was invited for drinking in Tokyo by my friend. I, my wife and our friends were meeting at 12:00 in Shinbashi to hold a year-end gathering. Her plan was that we were meeting at a Spanish restaurant at 12:00, but my friend was 30 minutes late, because she overslept. She said that she drank too much last night.
Anyway, we enjoy Spanish meals, wines, and talking. It was the year-end gathering, but it may be held again this year.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday lesson, I learned making plan and the difference between &amp;ldquo;will&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;be going to&amp;rdquo;. I use &amp;ldquo;will&amp;rdquo; when I decided to do something while speaking, and I use &amp;ldquo;be going to&amp;rdquo; when I say something that I decided before.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m sleepy, because I had many coughs last night. I&amp;rsquo;ve had taken some cold medicines, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. I need a medicine stopping coughs.
By the way, I had a explanation for studying abroad yesterday.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little busy this week. Because I&amp;rsquo;m going to move the department. So, I have to make documents for taking over. I&amp;rsquo;s not yet decided when I will be transferred.
The reason is that my department decided to quit Machine Learning Project that I participate in. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the true reason. But I suppose that because it takes long time to accomplish the goal. I was so disappointed with that, because I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying Machine Learning.</description>

Therefore, he said that you should be better to work at other department related with Machine Learning. Fortunately, the boss of my boss previously lead the center that contains the department related with Machine Learning.</description>

      <description>I have teamed up with three others for three months to tackle the training exercise about Machine Learning. Today, I went to Osaka to give the presentation about its results. I think that it was successful because we could answer some questions and the audience responded well. I submit the report and the source codes in a month, the training will be completed.
However, I must use what I learned in the training for my work.</description>

      <description>This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.</description>

Donaire was the strongest boxer in bantamweight until Inoue&amp;rsquo;s come.

He couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring his true strength.

I don&amp;rsquo;t like anesthetic injections into the gums. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt so much because the surface anesthesia is done first. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t like teeth cleaning because it spends time. Normally it spends 4 weeks or 6 weeks.</description>

      <description>In the previous lesson, I studied about healthy food and told what is in my fridge. And I gave my opinions for some beliefs about food.
One of beliefs what I heard of is that eating a bowl of salad at the beginning of a meal can give you a feeling of fullness and prevent overeating. And also chewing 30 times per mouth can prevent overeating.
In these days, I always overeat at dinner, so from now on I&amp;rsquo;ll do those methods.</description>

      <description>The pleasure of summer vacation My family used to go to Nagashima Resort in the summer, when I was a kid. Back then, I was always looking forward to going Nagashima Resort every summer. Both now and then, Nagashima Resort is the biggest amusement park in Kansai region; it has a tremendous pool, various water slides and roller coasters.
Nowadays, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to an Amusement park. I don&amp;rsquo;t like going crowded places these days because I get tired.</description>

      <description>Today, I worked at the office. This week, the progress of my work isn&amp;rsquo;t so good, because what I tried to end this week didn&amp;rsquo;t end. The reason is the lack of understanding machine learning.
I wanted to start training my machine learning model this week. I cannot start it tomorrow probably. Definitely. It can&amp;rsquo;t be helped. Next week I&amp;rsquo;ll try.
Last weekend typhoon no.19 came, however, I had no damage.</description>

      <description>Unit 4: Family life Lesson D: Family activities 1. Reading A. Yes, we did. I and my family used to eat together every dinner. We used to talk about what we did and how we feel. Plus, we used to talk about neighbours, friends, relatives, and TV show, movies, everything.
B: Why does Barbara think families should eat together more often? Because children who have regular meals with their families feel less stressed, have a healthier weight, get better grades, and are less likely to get into trouble than children from families that don&amp;rsquo;t eat together.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling well recently. I have a runny nose and lots of sneeze, and I&amp;rsquo;m dull. I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably because of air conditioning during sleep.
However, I can&amp;rsquo;t stop the air conditioner while sleeping. If I do that, I will get heat stroke.</description>

      <description>The surgery began at 9:00 am. The surgery was scheduled to end in 6 to 8 hours, but it took 11 hours. The doctor who mainly operated the surgery told us that the bleeding didn&amp;rsquo;t stop for a while and he hesitated to continue operating. Fortunately, the bleeding stopped and he continued. That is the reason that it took long time.
Moreover, he said that this cancer might have metastasized to the liver.</description>

Japanese government encouraged office workers to work from home last week and this week. Because the Tokyo Olympics will be held at the same time next year. They want to control the traffic jam at that time.
Therefore, I worked from home last Monday, last Friday and today. Moreover, I&amp;rsquo;ll work from home next Wednesday and next Friday, too.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to work from home everyday, because it&amp;rsquo;s very tiring to commute every day.</description>

At that time I lived in Fukuoka, but I used to go to Hyuga,Miyazaki for camping and surfing.
I had been camping in Hyuga that summer, and a typhoon came. The typhoon passed near my campsite in the middle of the night and left to the east. In the early morning of the next day, the wind calmed and the big wave remained.</description>

I learned algebra and statistics when I was in high school and university, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t used them very much recently. Because I used to use sophisticated software libraries, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to use them.
However, I have to use them from now on to understand the theory of machine learning and deep learning.</description>

      <description>How to make a conversation longer. The best way to show that you want to start a longer conversation is to ask open-ended questions. Open-ended questions have to be answered with more than one word and allow the other person to talk longer.
 1. Open-ended questions  What do you think about hoge? Have you heard that hoge? : (If they answer &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;: ) What do you think? What do you like about hoge?</description>

The person in charge will explain the detail of the proposal to me next week. Whatever the content, I will accept this proposal.</description>

      <description>I had trouble falling asleep last night. Because It was hot and humid night.
I heard that the function of the brain is blunted like drunken if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough sleep.
That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t concentrate.
In these day, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of buying a bigger bed that is comfortable to sleep.</description>

On the sandy beach, the construction of a sea house was being promoted at night, and I felt the arrival of summer.</description>

      <description>I was thinking of surfing today as I did yesterday. So I went to surf. But, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t surf, I was almost drown.
The low pressure made strong onshore winds and high waves, making it difficult for me to surf. They disturbed me trying to go outside.
The wind was weak early in the morning, so I wish I had gone surfing at that time.
In the afternoon, I watched a drama broadcasted on NETFLIX.</description>

      <description>Today, I went out for drinking with my wife and friends in Noge, Yokohama. It was drizzling rain, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad it didn&amp;rsquo;t rain heavily.
We went to three Izakaya bars. In Noge, there are many Izakaya bars, so people go to some Izakaya bars to enjoy various dishes and drinks.
One of our friends traveled to Spain for a week in early June. She gave us some presents. We were very happy.</description>

The reason what I worked from home today was that the typhoon was supposed to come. But it went to somewhere. There were no winds, no heavy rain and no lightning.
The weather was so fine and hot today. It&amp;rsquo;s a season that requires air conditioning.
I will go surfing tomorrow.</description>

Apart from that, Zozomat was announced. It measures your foot shape three-dimensionally in millimeters.

      <description>Today, I spent a depraved day. I watched anime all day long. It was One punch man.
This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.</description>

Sadly, however, the number of eels has been decreasing. It&amp;rsquo;s said that the reasons are overfishing and environmental change.
Since the ecology of eels isn&amp;rsquo;t known yet, complete eel farming is difficult.
Even now, research on complete eel farming is being continued, and it is said that it may be successful with a little more.</description>

Keynote (10:00-11:30) It was the almost same as the Day 1&amp;rsquo;s keynote. Furthermore, the presenter talked too much and it was overtime. Panasonic&amp;rsquo;s speech wasn&amp;rsquo;t good neither.

      <description>Today I watched Friends after a long time, because I thought that I could learn daily conversation by wathing this movie.
In NETFLIX, I can download its movies, so I can watch them during commuting.
To learn daily conversation, I will watch it twice each time. The first time, I watch it in Japanese with English caption to know what each its quotes mean. The second time, I watch it in English with English caption, so I learn pronunciation and expressions in English.</description>

NETFLIX is free for the first month, so during the period I will try to find out if NETFLIX is useful to studying English.
I like movies very much, so &amp;ldquo;what one likes, one will do well.</description>

I rode waves only a few times, and wiped out many times. The sea is fairly cold that I might caught a bit cold. Still, I enjoyed surfing very much and I will keep surfing.</description>

      <description>I bought this class a year ago, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been studying python so much recently. I&amp;rsquo;ll try learning python again for improving my programming skill.
This class is very good and reasonable price. I think it fits people who want to study python for the first time. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s fun for me to study python. I&amp;rsquo;ll learn python in a fun way from now on.
The progress of studying python is managed by the following github.</description>

      <description>I wanted to surf if the waves were high, but today the waves were too small to surf.
I have jogged along Shonan Coast for the first time in two weeks this evening.
The weather was a bit cloudy, but it was very nice.
I think I have to do exercise, because I have been gaining weight from before, I will continue to jog from now on.</description>

      <description>AWS DeepRace League - Technical Workdshop Yesterday, I joined the &amp;ldquo;AWS Deep Racer League - Technical Workhop&amp;rdquo;, because I wanted to have fun learning about machine learning. The AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&amp;rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It&amp;rsquo;s the Softech&amp;rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7&#39;0&amp;quot;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How to build your confidence - and spark it others&amp;rdquo; I lose my confidence when I fail and disappointed myself,
when I was given cold stares, when I was blamed, and
when I was ignored.
This TED talk, Ms. Brittany Packnett&amp;rsquo;s speech, gives me a confidence.
It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.
 Impressed words  Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it.</description>

      <description>Take a walk in London We had a little bit jet lag, so we were going to relax and take a walk in London. And we&amp;rsquo;d like to buy gifts in return.
London is a huge and advanced city, however, London has buildings from the Middle Ages. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing and attractive city.
Shopping We haven&amp;rsquo;t decided what to buy as gifts yet, so we were going to go window-shopping at Soho and Regent Street.</description>

      <description>Immigration I got a little bit nervous at immigration, because I usually get asked many questions at the immigration examination and I can&amp;rsquo;t answer well.
This time, however, immigration officers are very kind. Moreover, my wife said &amp;ldquo;This is our honeymoon&amp;rdquo; then, they said to us &amp;ldquo;Conguraturations!&amp;rdquo; with smile.
Tube We went to the center of London city by Tube: it&amp;rsquo;s subway in London. To ride Tube, we bought Oyster card at the station.</description>
