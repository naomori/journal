<h2 id="last-weekend-and-today">Last weekend and today</h2>
<p>I took a day-off today.
Because tomorrow is national holiday, it&rsquo;s culture day.
The purpose of the culture day is to promote our culture, and love freedom and peace,
In culture day, people who have contributed to the promotion of culture are honored.</p>
<p>I was just relaxed on last weekend and today.
I read books, watched movies, took a nap and jogged.
Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t go surfing, because there was no wave to surf, waves were too small.
I think the best luxury is to do nothing on holiday.</p>
<p>Is it OK if I go out for a bit?
Because the bread has just finished baking.
I have a home bakery, my wife often bakes a bread.</p>
