<ol>
<li>b</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s depends on the friend, I mean that it depends on the closeness with the friend.</li>
<li>If the friend is one of my best friends, I never let the friend buy a new one.</li>
<li>But unless the friend is my best friend, I would let the friend pay for it, definitely.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>a</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If I broke a camera borrowed from my friend, I would apologize for breaking it and pay for it.
<ul>
<li>I would never simply apologize, however I would ask him what he wants me to do.</li>
<li>Possibly, he wants a new one, or to repair it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>b</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Probably I don&rsquo;t feel hurt. That was over between me and the someone.</li>
<li>Even if I feel hurt, I never talked to either of them about it.</li>
<li>Because I don&rsquo;t want either of them to worry about me.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>b</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Of course, I will. And I&rsquo;ll serve some coffee to my friends.</li>
<li>Because I&rsquo;m not such a greed that I eat it alone.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>b</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I ask the friend why he can&rsquo;t afford it and why he wants it,
I understand the reason and then I would lend money to him.</li>
<li>If I lent him money, I will think that the money won&rsquo;t come back and I gave it to him.</li>
<li>If the money don&rsquo;t come back, I would have done with him.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>a</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll remind my friend about it until my friend pay it back.
<ul>
<li>I never forget.</li>
<li>If the friend don&rsquo;t pay it back, it&rsquo;s done with him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>What do you worry about?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I worry about corona virus.</li>
<li>Corona virus is out-breaking in Japan,</li>
<li>so that all my team members are going to work from home until the 16th of March.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want that corona virus spread anymore.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Who do you talk to about problems?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I talk to my friend about private problems.</li>
<li>For example, about trip, life in the future, jobs or something.</li>
<li>In case of business problems, I talk to my colleague.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you ever think of your diet?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I do, however I don&rsquo;t think of diet now.</li>
<li>I do care about meals, I try to eat much vegetables and not to take much salt.</li>
<li>But dieting makes me feel stress, feeling stress shorten my life.</li>
<li>So I will never do dieting.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>How do you remind yourself about things?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I remind myself about things using Google Calendar and Amazon Echo devices.</li>
<li>I register my schedule to Google Calendar and make Amazon Echo device refer to the calendar.</li>
<li>There are several Amazon Echo devices in my house, so I can always look at my schedule.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Can you forget about your problems?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>No, I can&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>I remember my problems until I solve those.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>Do you buy gifts to your friends?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I do.</li>
<li>When I have a trip to somewhere, I buy some souvenirs to my friends.</li>
<li>I like buying souvenirs to my friends,
because I enjoy to imagine my friend&rsquo;s expression when I give it to my friend.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li>Do you use cash to pay for things?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I do.</li>
<li>I sometimes use cash because there are many restaurants which receive only cash in Japan.</li>
<li>I try to use credit card or digital cash as possible as I can,
because they are convenience and I can get some points of it.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li>Do you apologize for being late?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I do, of course.</li>
<li>Being late is impolite. I should do.</li>
<li>Some people don&rsquo;t apologize for being late,
but they are never late for the meeting that their boss attends.</li>
<li>They look down at me, I guess.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li>How do you thank people for gifts?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I say thank you and express my pleasure to the person.</li>
<li>After that, I&rsquo;ll give some gifts to the person.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10">
<li>Did you ask a friend for a favor today?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>But when I had a trip to Aomori,
I ask my friend to tell me about local speciality foods in Aomori.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="11">
<li>Do you borrow clothes from friends?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>No, I don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Because there are different between me and my friend&rsquo;s sense of clothes and size.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="12">
<li>Do you lend books to friends?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When I was a high school student, I did lend books to friends and borrow books from friends.</li>
<li>However now I don&rsquo;t lend books to friends. Because I almost use digital books.</li>
<li>If you use digital books, you don&rsquo;t have to carry heavy books.</li>
<li>You just have a tablet computer.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="13">
<li>What can&rsquo;t you say no about?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I can&rsquo;t say no about my wife&rsquo;s favor.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not a favor, almost a command.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m scared to say no.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="14">
<li>Do you ever share secrets with friends?</li>
