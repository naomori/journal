<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmhl6rzVpM">Learn how to manage people and be a better leader</a></p>
<p>Think about this.
If two managers are equally good with their skills, but only one is a team player.
Who are the boss hire or promote?
The answer is obvious.</p>
<p>Employers do not want only professional expertise and experience in their employees.
They&rsquo;re also looking for other qualities: character traits for building rapport with customers and coworkers.
Interpersonal and communication skills that will help leaders steer teams effectively.
You&rsquo;ll be able to stand out in advance faster in your career,
if you have these traits and skills.</p>
<p><strong>These traits and skills are important.</strong></p>
<p>In this video, we&rsquo;ll share what some of these traits and skills are.
And show you how to use them in your interactions with customers, subordinates, supervisors, and co-workers.</p>
<p><strong>To use them in your interaction with customers, subordinates, supervisors, and co-workers.</strong></p>
<p><del>These tips have been taken from training programs in the Singapore workforce skills qualifications for leadership and people management, or LPM WSQ.
That&rsquo;s not all.
We&rsquo;ll also give you some pointers on how you can manage your own development.</del></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re able to build positive relationships with your customers,
they&rsquo;ll keep coming back.
However, despite your best efforts, things can sometimes go wrong.
Can you still maintain rapport with unhappy customers?
Yes, you can.
The key is in how you communicate with them.
Here are some ways to make your customer feel better.</p>
<p><strong>Customer.1: reiterate customer&rsquo;s view</strong></p>
<p>The first way is to reiterate his views to show that you understand.
For example, you can say
you&rsquo;re right, we didn&rsquo;t deliver the samples last week.
Follow up with something like this,
I&rsquo;ll make a call now to have them delivered today.</p>
<p><strong>Customer.2: customer&rsquo;s needs first</strong></p>
<p>The second way is to let him tell you what he needs before suggesting a solution.
For example, you can say
I have another idea to help you get the samples by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Customer.3: present pros and cons</strong>
For the third method present the pros and cons.
For example, you can say
that&rsquo;s right, if you receive the samples tomorrow, you can meet the deadline.
But if you could give us one more day, it will make a big difference to the sample quality and it won&rsquo;t affect the timeline too much.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Results</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re able to make two unhappy customers well,
you&rsquo;ll be able to continue your relationships with them.</p>
<p><strong>Subordinates: You need to be assertive to show your views honestly and yet be respectful</strong></p>
<p>If you want to get the best results from your subordinates,
you need to be assertive.
Assertiveness is not about bulldozing your way through
while disregarding people&rsquo;s feelings.
How then can you express your views honestly and yet be respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Subordinates.1: explain the reasons</strong></p>
<p>Explain to your team members why you need them to do certain things and how they would help the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Subordinates.2: Be open to suggestions</strong></p>
<p>Be open to other people&rsquo;s suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Subordinates.3: accept responsibility for your decisions</strong></p>
<p>And always accept responsibility for your decisions.
Otherwise how will your subordinates believe in what you say?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for you to build rapport with your supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisors.1: know how he prefers to process information</strong></p>
<p>One way is to know how he prefers to process information.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisors.1.1: visual person</strong></p>
<p>For example, if your supervisor is a visual person,
you can use graphs pictures and videos to help him visualize your message.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisors.1.2: auditory person</strong></p>
<p>For an auditory supervisor, let him hear your message through face-to-face meetings and phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisors.1.3: feeling person</strong></p>
<p>And if your supervisor is a feeling person,
get your message across through experiences,
such as site visits and product testing.</p>
<p><strong>Co-workers: 4 push and pull influencing styles</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re able to influence your co-workers,
you can help your project team reach desired outcomes and manage changes.</p>
<p>You may use one or a combination of these four push and pull influencing styles.</p>
<p><strong>Co-workers.1: push style.1 is to use logic</strong></p>
<p>One push style is to use logic.
Points out the loopholes of an argument and then offer a counterproposal.</p>
<p><strong>Co-workers.2: push style.2 is carrot and stick</strong></p>
<p>Another push style is carrot and stick.
Show your co-workers the reward they&rsquo;ll get it.
They comply and highlight the potential threats, if they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>Co-workers.3: pull style.1 is consultative style</strong></p>
<p>On the other side of the coin are the pull styles.
The consultative style is suitable,
if your team members are committed and capable of offering ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Co-workers.4: pull style.2 is big picture</strong></p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re working with senior and independent people,
you can move them using the big picture such as values mission and life goals.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s important to able to grow personally and professionally.</strong></p>
<p>Employers value employees who are able to grow personally and professionally.
These employees are able to take on greater responsibilities and challenges.
Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to manage your self-development well.
You begin by identifying your career goals, then embark on continuing education and training to help you build on your strengths, minimize your weaknesses and
reach your goals.</p>
<p>To get the skills you need to stay employable,

<p>I&rsquo;m doing good.
I worked from home as usual today.
And I had a job interview, it was a technical interview.
I got nervous and couldn&rsquo;t answer technical questions well.
I hope I will pass it.
But I&rsquo;m OK, it&rsquo;s good experience.
I will do well next time, at another interview.</p>
