<h3 id="what-i-wanted-to-say-but-i-couldnt-say">What I wanted to say but I couldn&rsquo;t say</h3>
<h4 id="talk-about-your-favorite-restaurant">Talk about your favorite restaurant</h4>
<p>My favorite restaurant is a pub that a brewery manages in my city.
You can drink several types of sake and beer that the brewery made.
I like sake especially &ldquo;Junmai Ginjo&rdquo; because it smells good and tasty.
&ldquo;Junmai Ginjo&rdquo; means that the sake is made of rice, malted rice and water.
In addition, the rice is polished to remove its surface,
as a result it has fruity flavor and soft texture.</p>
<h3 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h3>
<ul>
<li>buffet</li>
<li>casual dining restaurant</li>
<li>fusion</li>
<li>instead of, in place of, as a substitute for</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example1">Example.1</h4>
<p>When I stay at a hotel, I like buffets for breakfast.
If I can choose a casual dining or a buffet, I will choose a buffet.</p>
<p>I like a fusion of Japanese cuisine and Italian cuisine dishes.
Because I like both sake and beers which match such the dishes.
I choose a sake instead of a wine when I have those dishes.</p>
<h4 id="example2">Example.2</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about infection with coronavirus at restaurants.
So, I&rsquo;m hesitate to have dishes especially at buffet.
Because many people use the same tongs to pick up foods talking their friends or family.</p>
<p>Now the fusion of coronavirus and flu is the most scary virus, I think.
We&rsquo;d better stay home as a substitute for visiting a resort.</p>
<h4 id="example3">Example.3</h4>
<p>I made a plan to go on a trip to Toyama, Hokuriku region.
I reserved a hotel, but I didn&rsquo;t choose a buffet at casual dining restaurant for breakfast.
Because I&rsquo;m scared of infection with conronavirus at buffet.
I will buy some seafood at fish-market for breakfast instead of a buffet.</p>
<h4 id="example4">Example.4</h4>
<p>I like a buffet because I can choose a variety of foods.
For instance, there are Italian salad, miso soup, dumplings, something like that.
Therefore I&rsquo;ll choose a buffet instead of a casual dining restaurant.</p>

<h2 id="writing-10th-october-2020---english-language-test-suggested-for-australia-visa">Writing: 10th October, 2020 - English language test suggested for Australia visa</h2>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>a) What do you think about what you read?
<ul>
<li>I think it&rsquo;s a good idea.</li>
<li>Because the foreign partners can get about 500 hours of free English classes on government-run language programme.</li>
<li>And then, they will be able to communicate with local people more smoothly.</li>
<li>Therefore, it&rsquo;s good for both the foreigners and local people, I think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b) Why do you think the proposal is controversial?
<ul>
<li>Because some of the foreign partners will not be able to stay in Australia.</li>
<li>But it will depend on a purpose of the exam and the difficulty of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>c) Why might the test be seen as racist?
<ul>
<li>Because it will run people who can&rsquo;t speak English well out of Australia.</li>
<li>So, some people think that the purpose of the requirement is that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>d) How could you test someone&rsquo;s love for their partner?
<ul>
<li>I have no idea about that.</li>
<li>Because to test someone&rsquo;s love for their partner is very rude.</li>
<li>We shouldn&rsquo;t do that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e) What uphill struggles have you faced with English?
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve faced that I couldn&rsquo;t say what I want to say, I couldn&rsquo;t speak smoothly, and I couldn&rsquo;t respond quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f) What English tests have you taken?
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve had the TOEIC exam once before.</li>
<li>The reason for that was to pass the promotion exam.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t taken any English tests since then.</li>
<li>Because it was boring and tiring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>g) Is the test an unwanted additional burden?
<ul>
<li>Yes, it would be an additional burden and tough for some people.</li>
<li>However, I think a person who want to live in another country should learn a local language.</li>
<li>So, they should want to learn the local language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>h) What questions would you like to ask Australia&rsquo;s government?
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to ask what for the English test is.</li>
<li>In addition, I would like to ask how difficult the English language test will be.</li>
<li>Because we can know whether the it is discrimination or not,
if we know the purpose and the difficulty of the English test.</li>
