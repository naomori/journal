<p>I couldn&rsquo;t talk well the following things.</p>
<ul>
<li>My history about workplace, university and graduate school in my self-introduction</li>
<li>Why do I prefer rural to urban?</li>
</ul>
<p>I began to work at Meguro, Tokyo after graduate school.
About two years later, I changed my job.
Because I wanted to develop software.
I had deployed, managed and operated servers and networks,
however, I found that I liked also programming as well as managing networks and servers.
So, I wanted to work at place where I could do both.
After changing my job, I worked at Meguro, Tokyo for a while.
And then, I was transferred to Osaka.
I had worked there for about two years, and then I was transferred to Fukuoka, Kyushu.
I had worked there for one year, and then I was transferred to Osaka, again.
Two years later, I moved to Fukuoka, again.
I had worked at Fukuoka and then moved to Yokohama.
And now I&rsquo;m residing in Kanagawa.</p>
<p>There were lots of transfers in my company.
Now fortunately, I don&rsquo;t have to be transferred due to corona virus.
However, if I was told to move somewhere else, I would change my job.
I&rsquo;m learning English now, it&rsquo;s preparation for changing my job.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;ve lived in Osaka for university.
I like Osaka culture, like funny is the best.
And I also like Osaka local food, Takoyaki and Okonomiyaki.
After university, I moved to Nara for graduate school.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I wanted to live in urban.
But now, after lots of transfers, I prefer rural to urban.
I like nature, for instance playing in the river,
surfing in the sea, and camping in the mountain.
I&rsquo;m not a big fan of urban now.</p>
<h3 id="my-top-5-most-recommended-places-in-japan-to-visit-for-tourists">My top 5 most recommended places in Japan to visit for tourists</h3>
<p>I will recommend you my top 5 famous places in Japan.
First is Ise city, because it has the most famous shrine in Japan.
Main enshrined god is Amateras, she is the goddess of sun.
In addition, the city has a variety of mochi desserts.
Second is Miyazaki, because it has really good waves for surfing,
and they also have delicious food, especially meats: chicken, pork and beef.
Third is Aomori, because it has many kinds of apples,
and a famous summer festival called Nebuta.
I visited there this January and enjoyed so many kinds of apples.
Forth is Osaka, because I like Takoyaki and Okomiyaki which are Osaka local food.
I also lived there for university.
Fifth is Hokkaido, because it has delicious seafood and a beautiful snow festival.
I visited there this February. I&rsquo;d like to visit there again.</p>
