<h3 id="question">question</h3>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s fair that an athlete who lives in one country and competes in another country can come back to his/her home country to be part of the Olympic team?</p>
<h3 id="my-answer">my answer</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fair, I think.
Because a athlete who was born and grew up in a rich country has lots of benefit more than athletes of poor countries.
For instance, a certain comedian who likes a marathon wanted to attend the Olympic games in London. However he didn&rsquo;t have enough score to be a member of national team.
Then he decided to live in Cambodia and he tried to attend the Olympic games as a member of Cambodian team. He had score enough to be a member of Cambodian team, but IOC didn&rsquo;t allow him to be a member of Cambodian. Because he didn&rsquo;t live in Cambodia for enough time to be Cambodian.
He was born and grew up in Japan, so he could train himself enough and he could knew a method of running. Contrarily, Cambodian athletes are at disadvantage compared to him. If IOC allow other athletes to be Cambodian easily, pure Cambodian athletes can&rsquo;t attend the Olympic games.
It&rsquo;s definitely unfair.</p>

<h2 id="news-skorea-china-clash-on-social-media-over-kimchi---3rd-december-2020">News: S.Korea, China clash on social media over kimchi - 3rd December, 2020</h2>
<p>China and South Korea are arguing over a pickled food. The two countries are in a dispute over a savoury pickled cabbage dish.  China is trying to win an international certificate for pao cai, a savoury vegetable dish from Sichuan province.  However, South Korean officials are angry about this. They say this dish is too much like kimchi - perhaps the most famous food in South Korea.  Kimchi is a staple in Korean cuisine. It is a traditional dish of salted and fermented vegetables, such as cabbage and Korean radish. It is made with a wide variety of seasonings, including chilli powder, spring onions, garlic, ginger, and salted seafood. Pao cai is a pickle, usually made using cabbage, mustard, peppers and ginger.</p>
<p>South Korea is angry that China says it has won certification from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for its kimchi making process. South Korean officials say pao cai, &ldquo;has nothing to do with kimchi&rdquo;. They added: &ldquo;We need to understand that pao cai is different from kimchi.&rdquo; People in Korea are angry that China is trying to claim the standard for the kimchi-making process.  A professor in Korea said: &ldquo;China lacks efforts to understand the culture and history of surrounding nations.&rdquo; On social media in China, people said most kimchi eaten in South Korea is made in China.  One person wrote: &ldquo;Even the pronunciation of kimchi originated from Chinese.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of salted seafood.</li>
