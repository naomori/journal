<p>Do you like Japanese animation?
I liked it especially when I was a child.
For example, I liked the animation created by Studio Ghibli, featured robots and so on.</p>
<p>I still like it, because many wonderful animations continue to be created.
However, I prefer comics now.
Because comics allows you to go through the story at your own pace.
In addition you can imagine the details of the story, like the voice of the character, background sound, temperatures, smells and so on.</p>
<p>If you are interested in comics, why don&rsquo;t you read it?
You will see a lot of interesting and amazing stories,
and have a lot of fun to read them.
Moreover, you may come across interesting comics for which animated version have not been produced yet.
Let&rsquo;s enjoy comics, too.</p>

<p>Today it was raining and very windy.
I worked from home today as usual.
There was nothing unusual.
However, I drove for about an hour to take my mind off my work.
I drove listening to music.

<p>MeRISE Yvee to Everyone (6:23 PM)</p>
<p>I felt alone.
And worse,
it was my fault.
I wondered if I was just wrong.
An imposter.
A 22-year-old kid who had no idea of how things actually worked.
Now, years later, I understand that this is how things work
when there&rsquo;s no sense of higher purpose,
so it&rsquo;s up to all of us to create it,
so we can all keep moving forward together.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories is
when JFK went to go visit the NASA Space Center and he saw a janitor
holding a broom, and he asked him what he was doing, and the janitor replied,
&ldquo;Mister President, I am helping put a man on the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Purpose is that feeling that you are a part of something bigger than yourself,
that you are needed, and that you have something better ahead to work for.
Purpose is what creates true happiness.
JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before she finally wrote and published Harry Potter.
Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs to get Halo.
The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail.
Ideas don&rsquo;t come out fully formed, they only become clearer as you work on them.
You just have to get started.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>d) What are the arguments against vaccine passports?

</ul>
</li>
<li>f) Why are many people worried about having the vaccine?
<ul>

<li>In addition, there is not enough vaccine to deliver all around the world at all.</li>
<li>All countries are competing with getting the vaccine.</li>
