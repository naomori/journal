<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>My wife often complains about her boss.
She said that he sometimes jumps the gun and makes mistakes.
Moreover, her boss can&rsquo;t sit tight until others finish speaking.
When a staff is taking her own sweet time reporting the progress,
he is about to get pissed off.
Therefore other staffs are always wound up.
He is like trying staffs' patience.
She was on edge to change her job and then she was decided to do that.
So, she was on pins and needles waiting for the day to quit her job.
Nobody can told her to hold her horses.</p>
