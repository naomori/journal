<p>At the last lesson, I learned collocations related with food,
and that long adjective use superlative to represent the opposite meaning,
for example, the opposite of &ldquo;most favorite&rdquo; is &ldquo;least favorite&rdquo;.
And I learned that the type of banana I usually eat is Cavendish,
which has a normal sweetness among bananas.</p>

But, my wife is good at that.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m good at organizing my social life, I think.
I&rsquo;m introverted, and I don&rsquo;t have many friends.
I value my few friends. It&rsquo;s good for me.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m good at dealing with problems at work and school.

I guess that they&rsquo;re going to go a restaurant for dinner,
because 7:30 is dinner time.
I guess She&rsquo;s on her way home from work, so I think she hasn&rsquo;t had dinner yet.
And she said that she&rsquo;ll call for a reservation.

<p>Sometimes I think I ought to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> some volunteer work in a school or a hospital, but I&rsquo;m too busy just trying to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a living. I have very little free time, so I think I&rsquo;d better not add anything to my schedule right now. Am I right?</p>
<h6 id="coach">Coach</h6>
<p>Don&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make<!-- raw HTML omitted --> excuses. You don&rsquo;t have to spend all your free time doing volunteer work - three hours a week is enough. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> some research, and find an organization where you feel you can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a difference and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> some good for other people.</p>

<p>My boss is a bully.

<h6 id="coach-1">Coach</h6>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make<!-- raw HTML omitted --> any sense to ignore this problem, and you&rsquo;d better do something quickly before it gets worse. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Make<!-- raw HTML omitted --> an appointment with your Human Resources representative. You might want to take a colleague with you, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m meeting my girlfriend&rsquo;s parents for the first time next weekend. They&rsquo;ve invited me for dinner.

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with any comments, basically.
Because every life is different.

<ul>
<li>Q1: No, I don&rsquo;t agree with that.
<ul>
<li>She doesn&rsquo;t have to do any volunteer work.</li>
<li>Only people who have free time and money should do it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll advice her that she only has to think about making her life better now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q2: Yes, I agree with that totally.
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll advice him that he should record his boss&rsquo;s voice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q3: Yes, I agree with that, but partially.
<ul>
<li>He should dress smart and tidy, and take them a small gift.</li>

<li>He only has to show respect to his girlfriend and her parents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q4: Yes, I agree with that, but partially.
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s nice to make a list of the pros and cons.</li>
<li>But before doing so, he needs to clarify the goal and priorities of his life.</li>
