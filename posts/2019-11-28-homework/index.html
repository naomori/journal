<p>At the last lesson, I learned collocations related with food,
and that long adjective use superlative to represent the opposite meaning,
for example, the opposite of &ldquo;most favorite&rdquo; is &ldquo;least favorite&rdquo;.
And I learned that the type of banana I usually eat is Cavendish,
which has a normal sweetness among bananas.</p>

<h4 id="are-you-good-at-organizing-your-social-life">Are you good at organizing your social life?</h4>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m good at organizing my social life, I think.
I&rsquo;m introverted, and I don&rsquo;t have many friends.
I value my few friends. It&rsquo;s good for me.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think I ought to <u>do</u> some volunteer work in a school or a hospital, but I&rsquo;m too busy just trying to <u>make</u> a living. I have very little free time, so I think I&rsquo;d better not add anything to my schedule right now. Am I right?</p>

<h6 id="coach">Coach</h6>

<p>Don&rsquo;t <u>make</u> excuses. You don&rsquo;t have to spend all your free time doing volunteer work - three hours a week is enough. <u>Do</u> some research, and find an organization where you feel you can <u>make</u> a difference and <u>do</u> some good for other people.</p>

<h5 id="q2">Q2</h5>

<p>My boss is a bully. He yells at me if I <u>make</u> a mistake, and he <u>makes</u> fun of me in front of my co-workers. I&rsquo;ve tried talking to him, but it doesn&rsquo;t <u><del>make</del> do </u> any good. He won&rsquo;t listen.
I guess I&rsquo;m going to have to <u>do</u> something about this problem, but what?</p>

<h6 id="coach-1">Coach</h6>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t <u>make</u> any sense to ignore this problem, and you&rsquo;d better do something quickly before it gets worse. <u>Make</u> an appointment with your Human Resources representative. You might want to take a colleague with you, too.</p>

<h5 id="q3">Q3</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m meeting my girlfriend&rsquo;s parents for the first time next weekend. They&rsquo;ve invited me for dinner. I&rsquo;m going to <u>do</u> my best to <u>make</u> a good expression on them, but I&rsquo;m really nervous. Any advice?</p>

<h6 id="coach-2">Coach</h6>

<p><u>Make</u> an effort to dress nicely, and <u>make</u> sure you take them a small gift, such as flowers or chocolates. <u>Make</u> some nice comments about their home, the food, etc., but don&rsquo;t overdo it. You ought to let them <u>do</u> the talking at first. The most important thing, however, is just to be yourself.</p>

<h5 id="q4">Q4</h5>

<p>My boss recently offered me a promotion. I&rsquo;ve <u>done</u> a lot of thinking about it, but I can&rsquo;t <u>make</u> up my mind if I should take it. Sometimes I think I&rsquo;d rather stay in my current job. I&rsquo;ve got to decide by next week. What I should I do?</p>

<h6 id="coach-3">Coach</h6>

<p><u>Make</u> a list of the pros and cons of each job, and give each one a score form 1 to 5(5 = the best). Then <u>do</u> the math - add up the points for each list, and subtract the con totals from the pro totals. Which job has the highest score? Does that help you <u>make</u> a decision?</p>

Make word webs like these for do and make. Add other expressions you know. Then discuss the life coach&rsquo;s advice with a partner. Do you agree? What advice can you add?</h4>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with any comments, basically.
Because every life is different.
So, there is no coach for life, I think.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q1: No, I don&rsquo;t agree with that.

<ul>
<li>She doesn&rsquo;t have to do any volunteer work.</li>
<li>Only people who have free time and money should do it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll advice her that she only has to think about making her life better now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Q2: Yes, I agree with that totally.

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll advice him that he should record his boss&rsquo;s voice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Q3: Yes, I agree with that, but partially.

<ul>
<li>He should dress smart and tidy, and take them a small gift.</li>
<li>But, He doesn&rsquo;t have to do any nice comments about home, the food, etc.</li>
<li>He only has to show respect to his girlfriend and her parents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Q4: Yes, I agree with that, but partially.

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s nice to make a list of the pros and cons.</li>
<li>But before doing so, he needs to clarify the goal and priorities of his life.</li>
<li>That means setting evaluation criteria for his life.</li>
</ul></li>
