<p>For billions of people around the world, January the 1st, 2020 seemed like a great day. It was the start of a year that sounded like science fiction - 2020. Many people had great hopes for the year ahead. Few knew what a rollercoaster ride 2020 would be and how the world would change. The year has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has brought hundreds of thousands of deaths, economic chaos, lockdowns and masked populations. Another huge event was the death of George Floyd at the hands of U.S. police in July.  This sparked the Black Lives Matter movement and global protests. The year ended with Joe Biden being voted in as the President-elect of the USA.</p>
<p>Different people will have different memories of 2020. Our reporters asked people around the world to tell us what they will remember 2020 for. Ahmed Hussein from Lebanon said he would never forget the massive explosion at a Beirut port in August that killed at least 190 people. He said he thanked God none of his family or friends were hurt, but was sad at the destruction of his city. Lucy Baxter, a nurse in the UK, said her happiest moment came with the news of the vaccines for COVID-19. She said she could see light at the end of a long and dark tunnel. Ayumi Miyamoto of Japan was saddened by the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics but is happy they will go ahead in 2021.  She said 2021 would be a good year.</p>

<li>I think the whole world has changed in 2020.</li>
<li>We have a lot of things that we can&rsquo;t last year.</li>
<li>For examples, we couldn&rsquo;t travel, go out for a drink with friends, or enjoy concerts and events at all.</li>
<li>In addition, we needed to stay home to prevent the virus from spreading out.</li>
<li>However, we&rsquo;re seeing small light to exit the tunnel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b) What did you think 2020 would be like at the start of the year?
<ul>
<li>I thought 2020 would be busier than 2019 at the start of the year.</li>
<li>Because Tokyo Olympic games were scheduled to take place in the summer.</li>
<li>Moreover, my brother and his family were going to come to Japan to update their visa.</li>
<li>However, I worked from home for about a year and I&rsquo;ve not been to anywhere this year.</li>
<li>Therefore, 2020 I imagined at the start of the year is much different from the 2020.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>c) What was the best thing about 2020?
<ul>
<li>It was the best for me to work from home.</li>
<li>Because I didn&rsquo;t have to commute to work at all.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like commuting but I had to do it until last year.</li>
<li>However, this pandemic blown away our worthless commute.</li>
<li>I have time to jog or surf after work.</li>
<li>Therefore, it&rsquo;s the best in 2020.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>d) What regrets do you have about 2020?
<ul>
<li>I regret that I should have gone on a trip more in the world before this pandemic happened.</li>
<li>I could have learned about other cultures and people around the world, but I hadn&rsquo;t done that.</li>
<li>So, I will go on a trip a lot in the world after this pandemic has gone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e) How was your English studying in 2020?
<ul>
<li>I began to study English 2019 and I studied it much harder in 2020.</li>
<li>I feel I need to study English harder than ever.</li>
<li>Because we know we can talk with people all over the world through Internet even though we can&rsquo;t go anywhere.</li>
<li>We can work anywhere through Internet, so we will compete with people all over the world.</li>
<li>As a result, I need to use English frequently and smoothly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f) How much did the pandemic affect you?
<ul>
<li>It affected me a lot.</li>
<li>I can have better health than before the pandemic.</li>
<li>Because I began to work from home so that I don&rsquo;t have to commute to work and I got a good environment to work.</li>
<li>My room is more silent and useful than the office.</li>
<li>This pandemic relieves my stress about working very much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>g) What do you know about the Black Lives Matter movement?
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know about the Black Lives Matter movement very well actually.</li>
<li>But I know it&rsquo;s difficult to solve a kind of racial discrimination problem.</li>
<li>It will take a very long time to solve it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>h) What do you think of President-elect Joe Biden?
<ul>
<li>I think he will be better than at least Mr.Trump.</li>
<li>Because he will focus on climate change, economic, and medical care.</li>
<li>On the other hand, America will be still divided in 2021, I guess.</li>
<li>In addition, China will be still growing up and reach out other countries.</li>
<li>For example, African countries, south eastern countries like Vietnam, Philippines, Korea, Indonesia, and so on.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m afraid of war between America and China.</li>
</ul>
