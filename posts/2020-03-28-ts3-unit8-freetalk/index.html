<h2 id="free-talk-8what-would-you-do">Free talk: 8.What would you do?</h2>
<h3 id="1-if-you-had-an-hour-to-spare-right-now-what-would-you-do">1. If you had an hour to spare right now, what would you do?</h3>
<p>If I had an hour to spare right now, I would take a nap.
Because I couldn&rsquo;t sleep well last night.
I wake up at 3 am in these days, I don&rsquo;t have no idea.
And I sometimes can&rsquo;t sleep again.</p>
<h3 id="2-if-you-had-one-month-of-free-time-what-would-you-do">2. If you had one month of free time, what would you do?</h3>
<p>If I had one month of free time, I would go to Cebu for learning English.
I hardly can take a long vacation and it&rsquo;s useful to improve English skill.</p>
<p>I wanna go to Cebu for learning English,
however, I can&rsquo;t go to Cebu unless Corona virus is calmed down.</p>
<h3 id="3-if-you-had-to-choose-one-thing-to-keep-throughout-your-life-what-would-it-be">3. If you had to choose one thing to keep throughout your life, what would it be?</h3>
<p>It would be freedom.
I don&rsquo;t want to do whatever I don&rsquo;t want.
I don&rsquo;t want to be a person whoever someone wants me to be.
I want to use my time for free.
I want to do only what I want.</p>
<h3 id="4-if-you-had-to-choose-one-electronic-gadget-to-live-without-what-would-it-be">4. If you had to choose one electronic gadget to live without, what would it be?</h3>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a smartphone.
I use it for everything now, to pay money, to communicate with others,
to collect information and to put all my memories in it.</p>
<p>So, it would be a TV.
I can get all information from Internet.
I can read news papers, watch movies, listen to music and meet my friends on Internet.</p>
<h3 id="5-if-you-could-invite-a-famous-person-to-a-party-who-would-you-invite">5. If you could invite a famous person to a party, who would you invite?</h3>
<p>I would invite a rock band, Extreme or 10-feet.
And then I would ask them to perform on the party.
Good music is the complement to a lively party, I think.</p>
<h3 id="6-if-you-could-be-like-one-person-who-would-you-want-to-be-like">6. If you could be like one person, who would you want to be like?</h3>
<p>If I could be like one person, I want to be like Rob Machado.
He was a great competition surfer, but he was retired from competition due to injure.
Now he is a free-surfer.
He makes surfboard and rides waves around the world using it.
He surfs very relaxed and enjoy it so much.
He is enjoying his life relaxed, I think.
I want to enjoy my life relaxed like him.</p>
<h3 id="7-if-you-could-have-any-job-what-kind-of-work-would-you-do">7. If you could have any job, what kind of work would you do?</h3>
<p>I would work on a computer and Internet, as a software engineer.
It&rsquo;s the same with now.
I like to connect person to person or things to things using software.
Relationship and connection can improve our life, I believe.</p>
<h3 id="8-if-you-could-have-one-special-talent-what-would-it-be">8. If you could have one special talent, what would it be?</h3>
<p>It would be a multi-lingual translator.</p>
<p>I thought that it would be kind of a genius mathematician or genius scientists.
There are so many geniuses in the world, however,
it seems to me that they aren&rsquo;t happy
because people around them, even their family, can&rsquo;t understand what they see.
They are always feeling lonely, I guess.</p>
<p>On the other hand, multi-lingual skill would have me
to connect with so many people, and artifacts which people created.
It would have me happy, I think.</p>
<h3 id="9-if-you-had-to-give-up-one-habit-what-would-it-be">9. If you had to give up one habit, what would it be?</h3>
<p>It would be watching smartphone.
It wastes my time.
If I could give up watching smartphone,
I would read books and study English more.</p>
<h3 id="10-if-you-could-do-one-thing-over-what-would-you-do">10. If you could do one thing over, what would you do?</h3>
<p>I would start learning English earlier before.
I could know about around the world in more details.
Furthermore I could learn more interesting technical skill.
It would have me happier.</p>
