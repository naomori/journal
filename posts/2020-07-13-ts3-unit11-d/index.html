<h5 id="1-kids-saving-the-rainforest">1. Kids Saving the Rainforest</h5>
<p>The organization tells children about ecosystem of the rainforest, climate change and a nature-friendly way of life.</p>
<ul>
<li>A. You know, I&rsquo;m thinking of doing volunteer vacation in Costa Rica.</li>
<li>B. You are? That sounds exciting.</li>
<li>A. Yeah, anyway, there&rsquo;s this girl. She lives there. She started this organization.</li>
<li>B. Yeah?  Doing what?</li>
<li>A. Well, I guess she was only 9 at that time. She and friends were selling some their artwork and they decided to do something useful with the money.</li>

</ul>
<h5 id="2-cambodian-living-arts">2. Cambodian Living Arts</h5>
<p>The organization presents performances of traditional music and tradition dance in traditional costumes.</p>

<li>A. Yeah, you see, he wants to preserve traditional Cambodian music.</li>
<li>B. That must be very rewarding.</li>
<li>A. Yeah, well, I guess he&rsquo;s passionate about music. You see, he&rsquo;s flute player too, and his family owned a opera company in Cambodia, So&hellip;</li>
<li>B. I see. His organization helps young Cambodian learn about musical tradition.</li>
<li>A. Yeah, and they organize concerts something. It&rsquo;s a great book. You really should read it. I&rsquo;m actually thinking of writing to him. You know, to ask him to come on to give talk at our high school.</li>
</ul>

<li>A. Oh yeah, there&rsquo;s one girl. She was like only 12. When she and her family came to United States.</li>
<li>A. And anyway, she went back to visit Kosovo where she was from.</li>
<li>A. She realized they badly need books.</li>
<li>B. Right.</li>
<li>A. Yeah. So, yeah. She started collecting books to send there.</li>
