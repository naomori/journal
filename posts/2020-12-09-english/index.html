<p>China and South Korea are arguing over a pickled food. The two countries are in a dispute over a savoury pickled cabbage dish.  China is trying to win an international certificate for pao cai, a savoury vegetable dish from Sichuan province.  However, South Korean officials are angry about this. They say this dish is too much like kimchi - perhaps the most famous food in South Korea.  Kimchi is a staple in Korean cuisine. It is a traditional dish of salted and fermented vegetables, such as cabbage and Korean radish. It is made with a wide variety of seasonings, including chilli powder, spring onions, garlic, ginger, and salted seafood. Pao cai is a pickle, usually made using cabbage, mustard, peppers and ginger.</p>
<p>South Korea is angry that China says it has won certification from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for its kimchi making process. South Korean officials say pao cai, &ldquo;has nothing to do with kimchi&rdquo;. They added: &ldquo;We need to understand that pao cai is different from kimchi.&rdquo; People in Korea are angry that China is trying to claim the standard for the kimchi-making process.  A professor in Korea said: &ldquo;China lacks efforts to understand the culture and history of surrounding nations.&rdquo; On social media in China, people said most kimchi eaten in South Korea is made in China.  One person wrote: &ldquo;Even the pronunciation of kimchi originated from Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
