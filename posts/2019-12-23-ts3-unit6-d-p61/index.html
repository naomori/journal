<p>I&rsquo;ll make a list what to do when I have a lot to do.
I&rsquo;ll break them down into several small tasks which are up to 4 hours.
And I&rsquo;ll set priorities of them.
Finally, I&rsquo;ll start to work on the highest priority task.
I can give up some tasks and ask them to my colleagues, because I made all my tasks clearly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already set priorities of work, friends, and family.
Family has the highest priority, next is work, and finally friends.
Basically, I set the highest priority for things which I don&rsquo;t want to change and I want to keep.
I love my family, so I want to keep the relationship with them.
And, I set higher priority for things which I want to change and improve.
I want to improve my IT skill and English skill, and work can help me to do that.
Of course, I can earn money from work and I can live with my family using the money.
When jobs change, friends can change.
But friends cannot change my work.</p>

<p>I was having a really bad time about a year ago.
I&rsquo;ve just never seen to have any time.
I thought stressed and busy, and I just kept missing deadlines.
A friend&rsquo;s suggested that I try keeping a diary everything I did.
And I realized that wasn&rsquo;t using time effectively at all.
These days, I more organized.
I plan my weekend in advance.
And I get more done and I&rsquo;m far away stressed.</p>
<h5 id="2-c">2. c</h5>
<p>A few years ago, when I was in college.
I had a lot of projects assignment do it at same time.
I got really stressed and started having panic attacks.
My doctor suggested that when I felt stressed out, I take a walk.
It sounded like weird things to do.
You know, when you&rsquo;re really busy, but it actually worked.
Now, whenever I start to feel like I have too much to do.
I shut my laptop and go for a walk.
It really helps me to focus on what I need to do.</p>
<h5 id="3-b">3. b</h5>
<p>A co-worker gave me a great tip a few month ago.
Write a list of things you have to do for the day.
It&rsquo;s incredibly simple, but it works.
I used to have terrible problems prioritizing jobs.
So I was always have panic trying to get important jobs done,
because I had done less important work first.
Now, the first things I do every day is list what I have to do
with the most important jobs at the top.
That way I don&rsquo;t spend time on a small stuff, before I&rsquo;ve done the big stuff.
And I love closing things off my list too.</p>
<h5 id="4-f">4. f</h5>
<p>My biggest problem was that I put off starting jobs that would be difficult.
Then of course, as the time passed and work wasn&rsquo;t done.
I got more and more stressed.
I talked our friends about it, and his advice was to break big jobs down into
smaller more manageable tasks.
Then, focus on smaller tasks.
That way jobs wouldn&rsquo;t seems so huge.
It really helped me to stop feeling over around.</p>
