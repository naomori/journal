<ul>
<li>Elaborate my opinion. Explain more examples and situations which support the opinion.</li>
<li>Use idioms and phrasal verbs that I learned so far. I can remember and use them naturally using them frequently.</li>

<h3 id="how-are-older-people-viewed-in-my-country">How are older people viewed in my country?</h3>
<p>Elderly people are basically respected in Japan.
Because Confucianism affected Japanese for a long time.
In fact, Japan has the &ldquo;Respect for the aged day&rdquo; as a national holiday.</p>
<p>However, young people don&rsquo;t respect elderly people very much nowadays.
Because youth is more worth for working in modern society, I guess.
In addition, some elderly people require respect for them due to only their ages.
Therefore, some young people are bored and tired for such awkward elderly people.</p>

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have an English lesson today.
I will discuss about medicine.</p>
<p>In these days, several pharmaceutical companies are testing new vaccines against the coronavirus. For instance, Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, so on.</p>
<p>The UK government approved the Pfizer/BionTech Coronavirus Vaccine today.
I wish it will work well against the coronavirus.
However I guess it will take a long time for all of us to use the vaccine.
Therefore, I will be careful not to be infected with the coronavirus as I have been so far.</p>

<h2 id="news-thousands-of-argentinians-say-goodbye-to-maradona-29th-november-2020">News: Thousands of Argentinians say goodbye to Maradona 29th November, 2020</h2>
<p>Thousands of football fans paid their final respects to football legend Diego Maradona on Thursday. Huge crowds lined the streets of the capital Buenos Aires to catch a glimpse of the car carrying his body. The car was draped in the Argentina flag and a football shirt bearing his trademark number 10.  Thousands more silently walked past his coffin as it was put on public display at the Presidential Palace.  They were weeping, blowing kisses to their hero and praying. Maradona passed away on Wednesday, aged 60. He died of a heart attack.  Argentina&rsquo;s government declared three days of national mourning for him. One fan said: &ldquo;Maradona represents Argentinianess. He transcended football.  He has my respect. I had to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diego Armando Maradona is widely regarded as one of the greatest players ever to step onto a football pitch. Many consider him to be the best. He captained his national team when Argentina won the 1986 World Cup. He scored the famous &ldquo;Hand of God&rdquo; goal against England in the quarter-finals.  In that same game, he scored another goal that was voted as the greatest goal of the twentieth century. Maradona played for Barcelona in Spain and Napoli in Italy. Current Barcelona captain Lionel Messi said: &ldquo;Maradona will never leave us because Diego is eternal.&rdquo; Brazilian legend Pele, a constant rival to Maradona for the world&rsquo;s greatest ever player accolade, said he hoped to one day, &ldquo;play together in the sky&rdquo; with Maradona.</p>
