<h4 id="whats-your-plan-for-this-coming-new-year-and-how-would-you-arrange-your-plans">What&rsquo;s your plan for this coming New year and how would you arrange your plans?</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning to cook roast beef, chicken ham and so on by a pressure cooker in the end of the year and the beginning of the next year.
I already bought the pressure cooker on Amazon and received it.
Since it has many functions, you can do slow cooking.
Using slow cooking, you can simmer at a lower temperature than other cooking methods, such as baking, boiling, and frying.
Cooking meat at temperatures higher than sixty degrees will cause the meat to lose tenderness and moisture, making it less tasty.
I looked up the recipes on Internet, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to cooking using it.</p>
<h4 id="example-using-idioms">Example using idioms</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m drawing up to cook roast beef, chicken ham and so on using a pressure cooker in the end of the year.
I already bought the pressure cooker on Amazon and received it.
Since it has many functions, you can do slow cooking with it.
Using slow cooking, you can simmer at a lower temperature than other cooking methods, such as baking, boiling, and frying.
It is said that cooking meat at temperatures higher than sixty degrees will cause the meat to lose tenderness and moisture, making it less tasty.
I looked up the recipes on Internet and mapped out every step of cooking chicken ham in detail. I don&rsquo;t cook on the spur of the moment since I can&rsquo;t rule out the possibility of failure.
By the way, the plan for the beginning of the next year is in the works. In addition, my wife&rsquo;s birthday plan is still up in the air.
Anyway, I have a lot of fun to plan for those events.</p>

<h2 id="news-china-launches-clean-plate-food-waste-campaign-17th-august-2020">News: China launches &lsquo;Clean Plate&rsquo; food waste campaign 17th August, 2020</h2>
<p>China is taking action to cut down on food waste. The government has started a new campaign to encourage people to think about the amount of food they waste. It is called the &ldquo;Clean Plate Campaign&rdquo;. President Xi Jinping wants people to reduce the amount of food wasted. He called the waste &ldquo;shocking and distressing&rdquo;. There are many reports in China that a food crisis is coming. Food production has decreased because of the coronavirus and because of floods in southern China. Experts say this will not lead to a crisis, but the government wants people to pay more attention to how much food they leave on their plate. President Xi said China had to &ldquo;maintain a sense of crisis about food security&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Many restaurants are taking the campaign very seriously. A restaurant in central China went a little too far as it started weighing customers. It had to apologise to diners who were offended at being weighed. It said: &ldquo;We originally wanted customers to stop food waste and order food in a healthy way.&rdquo; A restaurant in the capital Beijing told the Global Times newspaper: &ldquo;We remind our guests when they order too much food.&rdquo; Restaurants in Wuhan have started the N-1 system. This is where groups of diners must order one fewer dish than the number of people in the group. Earlier this year, the United Nations warned that the world could see its worst food crisis in 50 years.</p>

<ul>
<li>a) What do you think about what you read?
<ul>
<li>I think Japan government ought to do the same thing like China.</li>
<li>Because Japanese also waste food and need to cut down on food waste.</li>
<li>In addition, food waste may affect environment badly, I guess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b) Why do people waste food?
<ul>
<li>People order what they want to eat without thinking about the capacity of their stomach, I guess.</li>
<li>As the result, people order too much beyond their capacity.</li>
<li>Finally, the rest of food turns out to be waste.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s too bad.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>I feel bad definitely.</li>
<li>Because I can judge the amount of food I should eat.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want them to mention about my weight or health.</li>
<li>I am not their child and I can manage myself.</li>
<li>Therefore, I must feel like that they insult me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>d) Should restaurants advise diners about food waste?
<ul>
<li>Yes, they should.</li>
<li>I want them to told me the amount of the dishes on the menu.</li>
<li>Because I want to fill eighty percents of my stomach to eat the dishes tasty.</li>
<li>In addition, I don&rsquo;t leave any food on the plate.</li>
<li>For instance, even if I eat everything I want and it fills in full of my stomach too much,
my good memory of the tasty dishes will be gone.</li>
<li>Therefore, I want to order dishes adequately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e) What do you think of the N-1 system of ordering less?
<ul>
<li>It sounds good.</li>
<li>However, I don&rsquo;t feel good that they control my order.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like not free to eat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f) How difficult would it be to eat less?
<ul>
<li>It would be very difficult to eat less.</li>
<li>Because humans try to avoid starvation as possible as they can.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s the humans' instinct, I think.</li>
<li>Thus, we eat too much, I guess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>g) What food could you not eat less of?
<ul>
<li>I can&rsquo;t eat less of potato chips.</li>
<li>I love it, so I can&rsquo;t help avoiding eating them.</li>
<li>I know that it harms my health.</li>
<li>But I can&rsquo;t stop it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>h) What questions would you like to ask Xi Jinping?
<ul>
<li>Do you really think if the system works? I want to ask him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
