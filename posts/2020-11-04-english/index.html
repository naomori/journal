<p>Many people drink diet sodas as part of their diet. They believe these drinks are healthier than fizzy drinks. However, according to a new study, &ldquo;diet&rdquo; versions of sugary drinks can be as bad for our heart as fizzy drinks that are loaded with sugar. The researchers who conducted the study said people should avoid diet sodas and other artificially sweetened beverages if they want to look after their health. They said the artificial sweeteners in diet drinks are not healthy. Dr Guy Mintz, a heart specialist, said: &ldquo;The belief that artificial sweeteners are a safe substitute for sugar is fake news.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;Artificial sweeteners have been associated with weight gain, insulin resistance, and diabetes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The research is published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Researchers looked at health data from over 100,000 people in France. Participants in the study recorded their diet, activity level, and health status every six months. The researchers said: &ldquo;Higher intakes of&hellip;artificially sweetened beverages were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting that artificially sweetened beverages might not be a healthy substitute for sugary drinks.&rdquo; They added: &ldquo;Water, water, and more water should be the beverage of choice. Given childhood obesity, no sweetened or artificially sweetened beverage should be a staple in children&rsquo;s diets.&rdquo;</p>
