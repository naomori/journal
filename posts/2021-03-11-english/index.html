<h1 id="today">Today</h1>
<p>I was in Osaka ten years ago today when the huge earthquake occurred.
At that time, at first I thought I was sick because I felt shaking my head.
However, it didn&rsquo;t. It was the 3.11 earthquake.</p>
<p>I thought its epicenter was near Osaka.
But it wasn&rsquo;t, it was 600 kilometers away from Osaka.
I couldn&rsquo;t believe that.
Moreover I couldn&rsquo;t believe that the huge Tsunami destroyed all:
fishing ports, building, bridges, airports, cars, and people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>In addition, unfortunately, nuclear power plants were melt down.
Not only Tsunami, but also radiation destroyed all.
People have been trying to overcome the disaster from the earthquake and its Tsunami.
However, the radiation continues to poisoned the land.
It is said that the radiation has not been gone for at least three hundred years.
I&rsquo;m overwhelmed when I think about how much work we should do for that.</p>
<p>Anyway, we will be able to overcome any difficulties like earthquake, tsunami, typhoon or even this pandemic.
I will do what I can.</p>
