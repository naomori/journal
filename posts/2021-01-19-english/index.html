<p>For billions of people around the world, January the 1st, 2020 seemed like a great day. It was the start of a year that sounded like science fiction - 2020. Many people had great hopes for the year ahead. Few knew what a rollercoaster ride 2020 would be and how the world would change. The year has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has brought hundreds of thousands of deaths, economic chaos, lockdowns and masked populations. Another huge event was the death of George Floyd at the hands of U.S. police in July.  This sparked the Black Lives Matter movement and global protests. The year ended with Joe Biden being voted in as the President-elect of the USA.</p>
<p>Different people will have different memories of 2020. Our reporters asked people around the world to tell us what they will remember 2020 for. Ahmed Hussein from Lebanon said he would never forget the massive explosion at a Beirut port in August that killed at least 190 people. He said he thanked God none of his family or friends were hurt, but was sad at the destruction of his city. Lucy Baxter, a nurse in the UK, said her happiest moment came with the news of the vaccines for COVID-19. She said she could see light at the end of a long and dark tunnel. Ayumi Miyamoto of Japan was saddened by the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics but is happy they will go ahead in 2021.  She said 2021 would be a good year.</p>

<ul>
<li>I think the whole world has changed in 2020.</li>
<li>We have a lot of things that we can&rsquo;t last year.</li>
<li>For examples, we couldn&rsquo;t travel, go out for a drink with friends, or enjoy concerts and events at all.</li>
<li>In addition, we needed to stay home to prevent the virus from spreading out.</li>
<li>However, we&rsquo;re seeing small light to exit the tunnel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b) What did you think 2020 would be like at the start of the year?

<li>Moreover, my brother and his family were going to come to Japan to update their visa.</li>
<li>However, I worked from home for about a year and I&rsquo;ve not been to anywhere this year.</li>

<li>Therefore, it&rsquo;s the best in 2020.</li>
</ul>
