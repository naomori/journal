<p>The doctor goofed up terribly on the surgery.
The doctor thought the patient had a serious irreversible disease on the right leg and the doctor cut off the wrong leg of the patient.
The patient had <del>a</del> <strong>the</strong> disease on his left leg <del>in</del> actually.
<del>Because</del> the doctor and his team got their wires crossed, <del>so</del> that he mistook the patient for another patient.
As <del>the</del> <strong>a</strong> result <del>he was</del> <strong>they were</strong> on the wrong track.</p>
<p>The doctor told the patient that <del>the doctor</del> <strong>he</strong> would do the surgery over.
The doctor said that naturally, not as <strong>if</strong> he made a slip of the tongue.
The doctor put his foot in his mouth at that time.
Therefore, the patient was mixed up <del>too</del> <strong>so</strong> much that he couldn&rsquo;t think straight.
Anyway, the doctor will be on the right track and won&rsquo;t mess up next time, because the patient has only one leg.</p>

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>Yesterday, the government announced to suspend travel campaign nationwide.
So, I&rsquo;m going to cancel my trip to Kanazawa in the end of the year.
Because we could save about forty percents of the total fee for the trip using the campaign, so I reserved the tickets and hotels for the trip using the campaign.
The government have told us that they would support travel industry and restaurants despite of influence of the coronavirus.
However, the government change their policy yesterday.
Unfortunately, I decided to stay home in the end of the year and new year days.
There is no choice.
I will go on a trip as soon as the pandemic settles down.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-news-metal-detecting-finds-ancient-treasure-in-uk-15th-december-2020">Breaking News: Metal detecting finds ancient treasure in U.K. 15th December, 2020</h2>
<p>The British Museum in the U.K. has reported record levels of historical discoveries this year. People have found more than 47,000 objects with metal detectors. Metal detecting is a big hobby in the U.K. Many people go out in the countryside to try and find old coins and other treasure. This year, more people have been metal detecting. This is because of the coronavirus. Metal detecting is a good hobby that means social distancing is very easy. People have been recording their finds on an app on the British Museum&rsquo;s website. The U.K. Culture Minister said: &ldquo;It is brilliant to see the [app] growing from strength to strength during lockdown thanks to garden discoveries and digital reporting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The British Museum said people have dug up many exciting and interesting things this year. Perhaps the best find among the new discoveries are two hoards of coins. One of the hoards contained 50 South African solid gold coins found 50 miles northwest of London. The other coin hoard contained gold coins and one silver coin featuring the British kings Edward IV and Henry VIII. Experts believe they were buried in the 16th century. Another find was an ancient Roman furniture fitting made of copper. It featured the face of the god Oceanus and dates to AD 43-200. The British Museum said the app, &ldquo;ensures finds, important for understanding Britain&rsquo;s past, are not lost but instead recorded&rdquo;.</p>
