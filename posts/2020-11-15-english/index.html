<h2 id="writing-scientists-develop-covid-19-vaccine-13th-november-2020">Writing: Scientists develop COVID-19 vaccine 13th November, 2020</h2>
<p>In a year that has largely been full of bad and tragic news because of COVID19, there is finally some good news. Scientists have announced a breakthrough in the fight against the virus. The scientists are from the U.S. drug company Pfizer and the German pharmaceutical company BioNTech. Their researchers say they have developed a vaccine that has a 90 per cent success rate in protecting against COVID-19. The researchers also say the vaccine does not cause serious side effects. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the USA&rsquo;s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the vaccine was positive news. He said: &ldquo;The results are really quite good, I mean extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Health experts say it will be months before the vaccine is widely available for people to take. It needs to be stored at temperatures of -80º Celsius.  However, Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla was upbeat about his company&rsquo;s achievement. He said: &ldquo;Today is a great day for science and humanity&hellip;.We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;Infection rates are setting new records, hospitals are nearing overcapacity and economies are struggling to reopen.  With today&rsquo;s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a muchneeded breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>a) What do you think about what you read?
<ul>
<li>I think it sounds really good.</li>
<li>Because it will end this pandemic.</li>
<li>It can help so many people and run the economical activities.</li>
<li>Therefore, I&rsquo;m excited with the news.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b) Who should be among the first people to get the vaccine?
<ul>
<li>It could be said that people who will be damaged the worst with the virus should take the vaccine.</li>
<li>Because they can be suffered from infecting with the virus.</li>
<li>For instance, they may have terrible after effect of the virus or be died.</li>
<li>Therefore, children and old people who have health problem ought to take the vaccine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>c) How big an achievement is the vaccine?
<ul>
<li>It will win the Nobel prize.</li>
<li>Because it will help most of people all over the world.</li>
<li>For example, if five percents of people in the world will be helped with the vaccine,
it will help three hundred fifty million people.</li>
<li>Therefore, the vaccine will be worth of the Nobel prize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>d) How has COVID-19 affected your country&rsquo;s economy?
<ul>
<li>It has affected my country&rsquo;s economy terribly.</li>
<li>For instance, It has stopped moving of people and removed eagerness to buy from people.</li>
<li>In addition, It has been producing a lot of bankrupts.</li>
<li>That is to say, it is about to disrupt my country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e) What will you do once the COVID-19 crisis is over?
<ul>
<li>I will go on a trip abroad.</li>
<li>Because I couldn&rsquo;t go abroad.</li>
<li>For instance, I want to go to Italy, Mexico, New Zealand and Taiwan.</li>
<li>I have been thinking about traveling around the world since this pandemic began.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f) What three adjectives best describe this story?
<ul>
<li>Amazing, Eager, and Necessary match this story, I think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>g) What should the world learn from the COVID-19 pandemic?
<ul>
<li>The world should learn from this pandemic how important exposure of information is.</li>
<li>Because the world was late handling with the pandemic, even though the coronavirus was found in the end of last year.</li>
<li>If the world dealt with the pandemic early, this virus wouldn&rsquo;t expand like this.</li>
<li>We shouldn&rsquo;t blame anyone, we should just learn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>h) What questions would you like to ask the scientists?
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to ask them how many times we ought to take the vaccine and how much it costs at once.</li>
<li>Because it will matter how quickly this pandemic will ease.</li>
