<h3 id="homework-make-sentences-using-at-least-4-phrasal-verbs-about-cleaning">Homework: make sentences using at least 4 phrasal verbs about cleaning</h3>
<p>When I was a child, I was not good at clearing up my room. Contrarily, my mother is neat and tidy, so she couldn&rsquo;t stand my dirty room. Thus, she often told me to tidy up my room and sweep it up at least once a week.
Now I am better organized than before. I always hang up my jacket when I come back, so my clothes are never jumbled up on the floor or the bed. In addition, my Roomba, which is a autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner, sweeps up my room every day.
A clean and tidy room livens up my feeling so that I can work from home comfortably.</p>
<h3 id="additional-working-1">Additional working 1</h3>
<p>Nowadays, there are so many robots in the house. For example, there is a vacuum cleaner like Roomba of iRobot Corporation. I have one. It can sweep up a room. However, if you want to use it, you have to tidy up your room first. You should put your clothes which are jumbled up in your drawers or hang them up because a vacuum cleaner can&rsquo;t clear up your clothes. Anyway the vacuum cleaner is useful and helpful for us.</p>

<p>I clean up the sink every day, but the sink sometimes is clogged up. I don&rsquo;t like it. Beside that, I don&rsquo;t like also using up dishwashing soap.

<h2 id="writing-researchers-want-to-correct-japanese-english---21st-november-2020">Writing: Researchers want to &lsquo;correct&rsquo; Japanese English - 21st November, 2020</h2>
<p>There are many types of English around the world. Some wellknown varieties in Asia include Chinglish in China, Singlish in Singapore and Japanese English. A group of language experts in Japan is troubled by how the government uses English. In particular, it says the government uses computer or online translation too much. Researchers say many translations create strange and confusing words and expressions. Many of these are confusing to English speakers. The researchers worry this could have a negative impact on Japan&rsquo;s tourist industry. They even say the increasing amount of unsuitable words is becoming a &ldquo;national embarrassment&rdquo; in Japan.</p>
<p>The researcher team says computer software gives odd or incorrect translations for individual kanji - the Chinese characters used in Japanese writing. There are many examples of this, including &ldquo;Hello Work&rdquo; - the name for job centres, and &ldquo;Go To Travel&rdquo; a plan to help tourism in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. The team says software creates, &ldquo;unintentionally funny translations that could easily be corrected if they were just checked by an English speaker&rdquo;. Businesses also create this English. The Christmas message being used by the Seibu Sogo department store has raised eyebrows. It says &ldquo;Stay Positive.&rdquo; Many people believe this is the wrong thing to say during coronavirus and &ldquo;Stay Happy&rdquo; would be better.</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>a) What do you think about what you read?
<ul>
<li>I think Japanese should study English more.</li>
<li>In addition, I should study English harder.</li>
<li>Because Japanese population is decreasing year by year and
this trend will continue for a long time to come.</li>
<li>Therefore, Japanese will have to go abroad to work or live.</li>
<li>That is to say, Japanese will need English than before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b) Have you ever made a big or funny mistake translating English?
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve ever made a lot of mistake translating English.</li>
<li>So, I don&rsquo;t remember all of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>c) What do you think of the name &lsquo;Hello Work&rsquo; for a job centre?
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s no problem, I think.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a weird name of course, however Japanese like personifying everything.</li>
<li>In a word, Japan government personified a job centre as &ldquo;Work&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Therefore, &lsquo;Hello Work&rsquo; is OK and we just greet to Mr.Work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>d) What do you think of the tourism slogan &lsquo;Go To Travel&rsquo;?
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s terrible, I feel.</li>
<li>I think even Japanese middle school students will realize it&rsquo;s wrong English.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e) What was the last thing to happen that raised your eyebrows?
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t remember it.</li>
<li>Because there were so many things that raised my eyebrows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f) What do you think of the &lsquo;Stay Positive&rsquo; Christmas message?
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s no problem, I think.</li>
<li>I know what the author wants to say
because &lsquo;Positive&rsquo; means to be infected with coronavirus.</li>
<li>However, that&rsquo;s overthinking, I feel.</li>
<li>I mean if this pandemic didn&rsquo;t happen
you won&rsquo;t think that &lsquo;Stay Positive&rsquo; mean to be infected with virus.</li>
<li>That is, we are too nervous about coronavirus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>g) What advice do you have for Japan&rsquo;s translators?
<ul>
<li>I have no advice for Japan&rsquo;s translators.</li>
<li>Because I&rsquo;m studying English and I am not an expert for English.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>h) What questions would you like to ask the researchers?
<ul>
<li>I would like to ask the researchers
what we should do for improving English skill for Japanese.</li>
<li>Many people want to speak English,
nevertheless most of Japanese can&rsquo;t speak English well including me.</li>
<li>Therefore I want to know how to study English well.</li>
