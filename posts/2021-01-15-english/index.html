<p>Reporters are saying the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have abandoned social media. The Duke (formerly Prince Harry) and his wife Meghan have reportedly said goodbye to their social media accounts. They want to focus on their new life together in the USA. The &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; newspaper in the UK wrote that the couple have no plans to use social media for their non-profit organisation or for their personal lives. The newspaper said the couple have become sad and tired of all the &ldquo;hate&rdquo; they see online. They both decided to step down as active members of the British royal family last year. Since then, many people have attacked and criticised them on their Instagram account.</p>
<p>Harry and Meghans' main social media account was @sussexroyal on Instagram. They have 10.4 million followers on this account but have not posted any new content since March 2020. A source told the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; that the couple were &ldquo;very unlikely&rdquo; to use social media again. Meghan has spoken out about the harm social media can do.  She was the subject of many attacks after she married into Britain&rsquo;s royal family. She said she experienced &ldquo;almost unsurvivable&rdquo; online abuse and cyberbullying. She added that she was the most trolled person in the world in 2019. This news comes as social media companies are in the spotlight for suspending the accounts of US President Donald Trump.</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>a) What do you think of social media?
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s convenient to contact with your family or friends you want to see.</li>
<li>On the other hand, in my opinion, people look tired and bored to show themselves luxury and happy.</li>
<li>It seems to me that they want others to admire them too much.</li>
<li>Therefore, I will use social media without showing myself bigger than real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b) How important is social media to you?
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not important for me at all.</li>
<li>Because I&rsquo;m not interested in famous people&rsquo;s lives.</li>
<li>I am interested in just my family and friends so that I don&rsquo;t often use social media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>c) What are the good things about social media?
<ul>
<li>Social media have good things to deliver your opinion around the world.</li>
<li>Even if you are not famous and any TV staffs are not interested about you, you can say what you want to around the world.</li>
<li>That is to say, you don&rsquo;t need mass media like TV or news papers.</li>
<li>You can upload your video into YouTube or upload your pictures into Instagram.</li>
<li>In addition, you can write everything you want to say on Facebook.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s of course if you are in democratic countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>d) What do you know about Meghan and Harry?
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know about them well.</li>
<li>I just know they were prince and princess in England.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e) What hate do you see on social media?
<ul>
<li>I saw someone abused other people on social media.</li>
<li>In my opinion, people who abuse others have many troubles on their own lives.</li>
<li>Those people want others to respect them even if they don&rsquo;t do anything good.</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t understand them and I don&rsquo;t want to understand them.</li>
<li>I keep a distance with them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f) What is the best social media platform?
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s LINE I use social media platform.</li>
<li>Because I always use it for contact with my family and friends.</li>
<li>In addition, they don&rsquo;t upload their fancy pictures which I see on Facebook or Instagram.</li>
<li>Because I don&rsquo;t open my accounts for anybody except my family and friends.</li>
<li>I like LINE&rsquo;s stamps. It&rsquo;s useful to express my feeling with just one tap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>g) What do you think of Meghan and Harry abandoning social media?
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s good idea.</li>
<li>They should have done that earlier.</li>
<li>They don&rsquo;t have to care about people who try to attack them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>h) What advice do you have for Meghan and Harry?
<ul>
<li>I have no advice to give them.</li>
<li>They should live on their own way.</li>
<li>Moreover, they don&rsquo;t need any advice from anyone, I think.</li>
</ul>
