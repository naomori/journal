<p>They are what I couldn&rsquo;t say what I wanted to say.</p>
<h3 id="why-did-the-current-prime-minister-of-japan-quit">Why did the current prime minister of Japan quit?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s because he has a health problem and it has been worse,
so he decided not to keep his post.
He has been the prime minister before <del>at</del> once, it was fourteen years ago.
He resigned from his post at that time because of his health problem.
That is to say, he resigned twice from the prime minister.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-japanese-choose-the-next-prime-minister-of-japan">How do Japanese choose the next prime minister of Japan?</h3>
<p>Japanese can&rsquo;t choose the prime minister directly.
Japanese prime minister is chosen by members of Congress.
Japan has a political system similar to England. It&rsquo;s the parliamentary democracy.
So, there is no president who chooses the prime minister.</p>
<h3 id="is-japanese-eating-manner-making-a-sound-when-eating-noodles">Is Japanese eating manner making a sound when eating noodles?</h3>
<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t.
Japanese don&rsquo;t think to make a slurping sound intentionally when eating noodles.
I think there are two reasons.
Firstly, they use chopsticks and don&rsquo;t use a fork that wraps pasta around.
Secondly, they don&rsquo;t move their face closer to a bowl or a dish.
Because it&rsquo;s a bad manner for eating.
Therefore, they slurp noodles eventually making a slurping sound.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-difference-between-kanto-region-and-kansai-region-about-udon-in-japan">What is a difference between Kanto region and Kansai region about Udon in Japan.</h3>
<p>The differences are <strong>the</strong> soup and softness of Udon.
The soup of eastern Udon is black because of soy sauce, and its soup is mainly based on dried bonito broth.
And its noodles is softer than western one.
On the other hand, the color of the soup of western Udon is light.
Its soup is mainly based on Konbu seaweed broth.
And the texture of western Udon noodles is like &ldquo;al dente&rdquo; of Italian pasta.
In addition, there are also many types of Udon in Japan.</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>a) What do you think of your weight?
<ul>
<li>I think I would better reduce my weight.</li>
<li>Because my weight is heavier than the average people who are the same height as I.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b) How important is a big breakfast?
<ul>
<li>The big breakfast is very important.</li>
<li>Because it boosts consuming calories and prevents high blood sugar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>c) Have you ever been on a diet?
<ul>
<li>Yes, I have.</li>
<li>Because I was told by a doctor that I&rsquo;d better be lighter weight for your health.</li>
<li>Moreover heavy weight can have a negative impact not only on my health but also on surfing and jogging, I feel.</li>
<li>Therefore, I tried to be on a diet. I&rsquo;m not on a diet now, though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>d) Is a big breakfast or big dinner better?
<ul>
<li>A big breakfast and a small dinner is better</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e) What is the best breakfast?
<ul>
<li>I think traditional Japanese breakfast is the best.</li>
<li>Because it&rsquo;s nutritionally balanced meals.</li>
<li>For instance, a rice, a green salad, a cup of miso soup, and grilled salmon.</li>
<li>A traditional breakfast in each countries may be good for health, I guess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f) Do you worry about the number of calories you consume?
<ul>
<li>No, I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t like dieting.</li>
<li>I want to eat without caring about the number of calories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>g) Should we eat what we want to and be happy?
<ul>
<li>We should do that absolutely.</li>
<li>Because we should care about not only our health but also our mental health.</li>
<li>On the other hand, we should not eat only something bad for health.</li>
<li>We need to love eating a variety of vegetables, seaweed, fish, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>h) Why are high-calorie foods so tasty?
<ul>
<li>High-calorie foods may make some narcotics in the brain that makes us feel happy, I guess.</li>
<li>People can&rsquo;t stop eating high-calorie foods because of that, I think.</li>
<li>For instance, the proportion of men with obesity in Japan has been increasing for a half century.</li>
<li>Therefore, we need self-control.</li>
