<p>I&rsquo;m not good at telephoning actually.
Since my colleagues receive business phone calls thankfully,
I usually don&rsquo;t have to receive them.
However, sometimes I have to receive a business call.
I remember when I received a business call in English.
I tried to speak carefully and clearly, but the person on the other end of the line didn&rsquo;t seem to understand much of what I was saying.
Therefore, I don&rsquo;t like telephoning.
My favorite work is programming and writing documents that I don&rsquo;t have to talk with anyone on the phone.</p>

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>This Monday, the government announced to suspend travel campaign nationwide.
So, I canceled my trip to Kanazawa in the end of the year and trip to Okinawa in the beginning of the year.
Because I reserved the flight tickets and hotels for the trip using the campaign.
We could save about forty percents of the total fee for the trip using the campaign.
The government have told us that they would support travel industry and restaurants despite of influence of the coronavirus.
However, the government change their policy this Monday.
Unfortunately, I decided to stay home in the end of the year and new year days.
There is no choice.
I will go on a trip as soon as the pandemic settles down.</p>

<li>Talk about the last time you had to apologize for.
<ul>
<li>I apologize to my wife every day for what I didn&rsquo;t do.</li>
<li>Because she did most of chores and I often forget doing some chores I should have done.</li>
<li>She is organized, contrarily I&rsquo;m not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is it that you had been afraid of trying but recently overcame?
<ul>
<li>I had been afraid of that people around me didn&rsquo;t like me.</li>
<li>However, I overcame it since I realized that they doesn&rsquo;t matter for my life.</li>
<li>I realized that I should care of my family and best friends.</li>
<li>Because acquaintances and colleagues will surely be gone someday.</li>
<li>For instance, when I change a job or a residence.</li>
<li>Therefore, I decided to keep in touch with my family and best friends, not acquaintances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Describe what you do for a living.
<ul>
<li>I work for a living.</li>
<li>For example, I make some software or documents for my company and get my salary.</li>
