<h2 id="breaking-news-uk-government-votes-against-free-meals-for-poorer-children">Breaking News: UK government votes against free meals for poorer children</h2>
<p>The UK government voted against giving poor children free school lunches during the school holidays. Only five politicians in the ruling Conservative party voted to help poorer children with a daily lunch. A huge majority of the government voted against the weekly $20-perchild food voucher. The government is now under pressure to make a U-turn. It made a U-turn in the summer over free school meals. The Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford started a successful campaign to get the government to reverse its decision not to provide school lunches for poorer children during the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Rashford has started another campaign to pressure the government into another U-turn.</p>
<p>The UK government is under growing pressure to Uturn. The British public is furious that politicians are refusing to provide the food vouchers. For many children, the voucher would mean getting their only proper meal of the day during the holidays. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would not U-turn. He said: &ldquo;I totally understand the issue of holiday hunger&rdquo;. Many people on social media said Mr Johnson does not understand hunger because he comes from a wealthy family and has always had money. People are angry COVID-19 track-and-trace consultants are paid over $8,000 a day but children cannot have a $20 food voucher. Many stores across the UK are banning politicians from their businesses.</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>a) What do you think about what you read?
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t understand the politicians in the UK voted against the law.</li>
<li>I guess they don&rsquo;t want to spend much money for it.</li>
<li>Because they have already used money for the pandemic.</li>
<li>Therefore, they voted the against it. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good, though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>b) What do you think the UK government will do?
<ul>
<li>I think the UK government will give the voucher for poor children eventually.</li>
<li>Because most British want the UK government to do that.</li>
<li>The government will have no choice to do it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>c) What did you have for lunch when you were at school?
<ul>
<li>I took a lunch box when I was a student,</li>
<li>It made by my mother every morning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>d) Why do rich politicians say they understand poor people&rsquo;s lives?
<ul>
<li>Because they want to make a excuse for voting against the law, I guess.</li>
<li>However, they don&rsquo;t understand it at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e) What do you think of wealthy politicians?
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t care about politicians' wealth.</li>
<li>I do care their performance as politicians.</li>
<li>I expect for them to make laws which make us happy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>f) Should track-and-trace consultants be paid $8,000 a day?
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know about what they&rsquo;re doing as track-and-trace consultants.</li>
<li>So, I have no idea whether or not the job worths for $8,000 a day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>g) Are businesses right to ban politicians?
<ul>
<li>No, they aren&rsquo;t.</li>
