<h4 id="a-what-are-your-neighbors-like-do-you-get-along-with-them-tell-the-class">A. What are your neighbors like? Do you get along with them? Tell the class.</h4>
<p>My neighbors next door are a man and his daughter.
It seems to me that they get along well, because I sometimes see they&rsquo;re talking with smile.
But late at night once or twice, I heard him to shout like being drunk,
so I&rsquo;m bit worried about it.
In these days I haven&rsquo;t heard him to shout, it&rsquo;s OK now, I think.</p>
<p>And another neighbors next door at opposite side are a woman and her father, maybe.
I have not seen her father, but I heard a old man&rsquo;s voice once.
The woman have not greeted me even if I said &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the city, not country side, the relationships are weak.
We don&rsquo;t know neighbors&rsquo; name even next door.</p>
<h4 id="b-what-does-olivia-think-about-her-new-neighbor-what-are-adams-neighbors-like">B. What does Olivia think about her new neighbor? What are Adam&rsquo;s neighbors like?</h4>
<p>Olivia thinks that her new neighbor is a little bit strange, kind of weird, and just a bit odd.
Because her neighbor always coming over and borrowing things for her,
and sometimes she sort of ignores her.</p>
<p>Adams thinks that he don&rsquo;t know about his neighbors,
because nobody in his building ever speaks.</p>

<h4 id="a">A.</h4>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s funny.
There are some people that I look forward to seeing.
I don&rsquo;t mean friends but like people I see everyday or once a week or something.
Like, there is the woman who works in the coffee shop.
I always get coffee in the morning before work.
And it gets kind of busy, you know.
And she gets a little stressed out where there&rsquo;re lots of people.
She&rsquo;s really friendly and positive, though.
She always smiles and asks &ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo;
I guess I look forward to seeing her.
Because it&rsquo;s nice to see someone who&rsquo;s friendly in the morning.</li>

<li>Another person I enjoyed seeing is my yoga instructor.
I just started yoga a couple of months ago.
And, yeah, the teacher&rsquo;s really good.
He&rsquo;s kind of stretch, though.
Like, he makes us do things over and over until we get it right.
But he&rsquo;s really good at explaining things.
So, yeah. I really look forward to his class.
Because I always learn something new.
And the other students in the class are nice.
Well, one guy always asking questions, though.
He gets sort of annoying, really. But&hellip;</li>

<li>I go biking every weekend.
There&rsquo;s a group of us who go together.
And there&rsquo;s one guy who&rsquo;s like the worst biker.
He&rsquo;s incredibly funny, though.
His name&rsquo;s Ed.
And he&rsquo;s always telling jokes and funny stories.
Anyway, he and I are always at the back of the group.
I guess the other guys are kind of serious about biking.
I mean, I&rsquo;m not, but I look forward to the ride every week.
Because, well, I guess I just enjoy the company.</li>
