<h4 id="a-what-are-your-neighbors-like-do-you-get-along-with-them-tell-the-class">A. What are your neighbors like? Do you get along with them? Tell the class.</h4>
<p>My neighbors next door are a man and his daughter.
It seems to me that they get along well, because I sometimes see they're talking with smile.
But late at night once or twice, I heard him to shout like being drunk,
so I'm bit worried about it.
In these days I haven't heard him to shout, it's OK now, I think.</p>
<p>And another neighbors next door at opposite side are a woman and her father, maybe.
I have not seen her father, but I heard a old man's voice once.
The woman have not greeted me even if I said &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the city, not country side, the relationships are weak.
We don't know neighbors&rsquo; name even next door.</p>
<h4 id="b-what-does-olivia-think-about-her-new-neighbor-what-are-adams-neighbors-like">B. What does Olivia think about her new neighbor? What are Adam's neighbors like?</h4>
<p>Olivia thinks that her new neighbor is a little bit strange, kind of weird, and just a bit odd.
Because her neighbor always coming over and borrowing things for her,
and sometimes she sort of ignores her.</p>
<p>Adams thinks that he don't know about his neighbors,
because nobody in his building ever speaks.</p>

<h4 id="a">A.</h4>
<ol>
<li>It's funny.
There are some people that I look forward to seeing.
I don't mean friends but like people I see everyday or once a week or something.
Like, there is the woman who works in the coffee shop.
I always get coffee in the morning before work.
And it gets kind of busy, you know.
And she gets a little stressed out where there're lots of people.
She's really friendly and positive, though.
She always smiles and asks &ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo;
I guess I look forward to seeing her.
Because it's nice to see someone who's friendly in the morning.</li>

<li>Another person I enjoyed seeing is my yoga instructor.
I just started yoga a couple of months ago.
And, yeah, the teacher's really good.
He's kind of stretch, though.
Like, he makes us do things over and over until we get it right.
But he's really good at explaining things.
So, yeah. I really look forward to his class.
Because I always learn something new.
And the other students in the class are nice.
Well, one guy always asking questions, though.
He gets sort of annoying, really. But&hellip;</li>

<li>I go biking every weekend.
There's a group of us who go together.
And there's one guy who's like the worst biker.
He's incredibly funny, though.
His name's Ed.
And he's always telling jokes and funny stories.
Anyway, he and I are always at the back of the group.
I guess the other guys are kind of serious about biking.
I mean, I'm not, but I look forward to the ride every week.
Because, well, I guess I just enjoy the company.</li>
