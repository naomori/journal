<h2 id="wheres-san-franciscos-spirit-of-tolerance-came-from">Where&rsquo;s San Francisco&rsquo;s spirit of tolerance came from</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about characteristics of city culture, reading the article below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200506-wheres-san-franciscos-spirit-of-tolerance-came-from">Where&rsquo;s San Francisco&rsquo;s spirit of tolerance came from</a></li>
</ul>
<p>San Francisco has always been known as a city of nonconformity.
But in recent decades, already-outlandish San Francisco rents and everyday prices has been inflating
and living costs has been pushed to 25% higher than the national average.
These high fees are driving out many of the city’s artists, writers and long-time residents.
So, many people wonder whether San Francisco&rsquo;s progressive, open-minded attitude can survive.</p>
<p>The history of San Francisco, like gold rush, hippie movement and gay rights movement etc has grown
liberal-mindedness and progressive thinking.
In conclusion, the writer said,
Change in the city is inevitable, but it can also be good.
Because there are many San Francisco residents and organisations working to address such issues,
as well as continuing to find new ways to come together peacefully and open-mindedly.</p>
<p>I feel interesting, reading this article.
Because I haven&rsquo;t felt anything characteristic of cities in Japan so far.
Of course, there is a difference between each cities and each town.
However, it&rsquo;s not obviously different between their city cultures, I think.
It&rsquo;s different just between scenery, building, foods, drink or something.
In the big city, people is little bit more liberal than country side.
In the country side, people is little bit more conservative than big city.
Something like that.</p>
<p>I think the difference come from organization of country.
In US, each states are independent from federal government in a way.
Each states have their own constitutions and laws, so they can decided so many things by themselves.
On the other hand, in Japan each prefecture can&rsquo;t have their own constitutions and laws.
And each prefecture don&rsquo;t have money much, Japan government has most money.
So, each prefecture governor ask Japan government for money or ask to build something in their prefecture.
Each prefecture can&rsquo;t help obeying Japan government.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s your country?
What characterstic is your city?
What do you feel a city where you live?</p>
