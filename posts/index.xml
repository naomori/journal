      <description>At last lesson, my teacher Cathy said that I have to research about Zen and I have to tell her what is Zen and how to do Zen. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to explain about Zen, I think. Because Zen is one of religions, so it must be complicated and confusing. At first, I searched Zen by Google.
Zen is one of training of Zenshu. Zenshu is one sect of Buddhism, and the goal of Zenshu is to attain spiritual enlightenment.</description>

      <description>Unit-8: What if? Lesson.A: Wishes 1. Getting started A. What would you like more of in your life? I can&amp;rsquo;t speak English smoothly and naturally. So I wish I could speak English well. If I could speak English well, I could enjoy movies, musical, and trip more than before, definitely. Furthermore, if I do that, I&amp;rsquo;d get a interesting job and work happily. And if I win a lottery, I&amp;rsquo;d probably take long vacations to go all around the world.</description>

      <description>I worked at home, today and last Wednesday. Because Corona virus is out-breaking now in Japan, so that I avoid crowed places as possible as I can.
Some people says it&amp;rsquo;s too much to worry about. Yeah, I know. But, my wife is weak, so it will be a problem if she is infected with corona virus. Because corona virus kills people who have a health problem.
I wish that corona virus doesn&amp;rsquo;t spread any more.</description>

      <description>At today&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I talked about one of my best friends, how we met, where we became friends and his characteristics using &amp;ldquo;both&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;neither&amp;rdquo;. Finally, I reviewed this unit through vocabulary notebook, phrasal verbs.
Next lesson, I&amp;rsquo;m going to make some sentences using phrasal verbs, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll start unit 8. So that I have to review those phrasal verbs. My teacher said that you will use phrasal verbs in usual conversation and so it&amp;rsquo;s useful and you should learn phrasal verbs definitely.</description>

      <description>I went to Sapporo last weekend. It was the first time to visit Sapporo for me. I enjoyed a snowy landscape, Snow festival, and food and drink, of course. It was an amazing trip totally.
When I arrived at Chitose airport, it was not much cold. I felt it was the same temperature as Kanagawa. It was negative two degrees in Sapporo and positive two degrees in Kanagawa, actually. It was just a little bit difference.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I learned to soften comments and make sentences using those phrases. And I tried to continue speaking for one minute about something theme.
I sometimes couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my words, however, I almost could continue speaking. It was prepared theme in advance, not free theme, though. My teacher, Cathay said that I prepared every lessons in advance and it was good, but I prepared too much, though. She meant that I only studied a few situations that the book described.</description>

      <description>I learned softening comments using &amp;ldquo;I think&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;a little bit&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;maybe&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;kind of&amp;rdquo;, etc. In addition, I made some sentences with those expressions to soften. I mostly made it, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly, though.
I&amp;rsquo;ll practice more and more.</description>

      <description>Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.C: She&amp;rsquo;s just a bit odd. 1. Conversation strategy: Softening comments A. What are your neighbors like? Do you get along with them? Tell the class. My neighbors next door are a man and his daughter. It seems to me that they get along well, because I sometimes see they&amp;rsquo;re talking with smile. But late at night once or twice, I heard him to shout like being drunk, so I&amp;rsquo;m bit worried about it.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I practiced to continue speaking for one minute. In addition, I practiced to use some common phrasal verbs and various conjunctions. It was difficult to build my opinion, and use phrasal verbs and various conjunctions at the same time. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any words and use those phrasal verbs and conjunctions very much.
On the other hand, the phrasal verbs and various conjunctions like those are important to casual conversation.</description>

      <description>Before starting Lesson C. I will do homework about Lesson B.
Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B, Section.2 A.7-9 7. First dates usually turn out to be a disaster! I agree with that partially. Not usually, sometimes it turns out to be a disaster. Because someone who don&amp;rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&amp;rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&amp;rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&amp;rsquo;t like.</description>

I had wrist-ache. I don&amp;rsquo;t the reason, but I have been typed a keyboard too much, I think. It&amp;rsquo;s painful even if I do nothing. I hope that it&amp;rsquo;s cured soon.</description>

      <description>I learned some vocabularies and grammars about dating. And I learned some phrasal verbs like get along, go out, break up and so on.
In addition, I learned elope and burn bridge. &amp;ldquo;Elope&amp;rdquo; means to leave from your home to get married even though your parents don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to do that. And &amp;ldquo;burn bridge&amp;rdquo; means that you can&amp;rsquo;t get back once you&amp;rsquo;ve done that.
I tried to speak for one minute about anything, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B: Dating 1. Building vocabulary and grammar A. High school sweethearts I have some questions about vocabularies.
&amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;work out&amp;rdquo; emphasizes this expression? If this statement doesn&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo;, does it have the same meanings?
What does &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; mean? I think that there is an inconsistency between &amp;ldquo;they are now living&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo;. Because &amp;ldquo;they are now living&amp;rdquo; means the current and &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; means the future.</description>

Yesterday, I went jogging for an hour at the seaside, and I walked for two hours to play game, Dragon Quest walk, kind of Pokemon go. I was too tired so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have enough sleep.
The reason that I did too much exercise is the&amp;hellip; No special reason.</description>

      <description>This weekend was relaxing days. I went to the city library and borrowed a book, the title is &amp;ldquo;Talking to My Daughter About the Economy.&amp;quot;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t read it yet.
After that I went to shopping at near super market and bought lots of food and drink. Because I had a trip to Aomori two weekends ago, so that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go to shopping.
In addition, I run at the seaside for about 1 hour, 10 kilo meters.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I reviewed Unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. It&amp;rsquo;s about ways to talk about the future and food. Again I tried to get off the phone, I didn&amp;rsquo;t do well though. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t end the conversation smoothly and naturally.
I finished Unit 4 to 6 at last, so next lesson, I&amp;rsquo;m going to begin Unit 7 about relationships. I&amp;rsquo;m little worried whether I can do well, because I&amp;rsquo;m introverted.</description>

      <description>I and my wife enjoyed a 3-days trip in Aomori last weekend. We traveled by train. I have never taken the Tohoku shinkansen until this time. I was looking forward to a train lunch box in the Tohoku shinkansen. Unfortunately, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t sold in the train. I don&amp;rsquo;t why it wasn&amp;rsquo;t, however, I was disappointed with that. Probably, Tokyo lunch box isn&amp;rsquo;t popular very much.
Day 1, after four and half hours train, we arrived in Aomori at 1:00 pm.</description>

      <description>At yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned to build sentences using common collocations with do, make, and etc. In addition, I reviewed unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively. I used too many times &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; as conjunctions, though. I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.
At last I&amp;rsquo;ll be transferred to new department. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.</description>

      <description>Vocabulary notebook 2. Write sentences to help you remember these expressions. Do some thinking I&amp;rsquo;m doing some thinking. But I have no idea.
Do something fun I want to do something fun. But I can&amp;rsquo;t make up my mind to do surfing, camping, or traveling.
Do volunteer work I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do volunteer work now. Because I&amp;rsquo;m really busy for work.
Make a decision I made a decision that affected my life.</description>

      <description>Today is my wife&amp;rsquo;s birthday. I presented fluffy pajamas, champagne and a champagne glass to her. She was very pleased and I was glad to see that. The fluffy pajamas was Gelato pique&amp;rsquo;s one that she&amp;rsquo;s been wanted before. Champagne was Veuve Clicquot that is the one of her favorite. And the champagne glass was Riedel&amp;rsquo;s one. Riedel&amp;rsquo;s glass makes a difference in taste of wine.
Even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t a wine expert, you can feel the difference between normal glass and Riedel&amp;rsquo;s one.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I answered a question whose the person couldn&amp;rsquo;t have time to listen to recordings of his lectures. My advice was taking notes of his lectures, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take time rather than listening to the recordings.
And I learned the meanings of &amp;ldquo;on the good side&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;undecided&amp;rdquo;. And &amp;ldquo;make a difference&amp;rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &amp;ldquo;make a &amp;lsquo;some adjective&amp;rsquo; impression&amp;rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.</description>

      <description>D. Read the Help note. Then read the question and answer with as long as, provided that, or unless. Question I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be more organized, so I decided to record my lectures, but I never have time to watch them. Any ideas?
Answer You can&amp;rsquo;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.</description>

      <description>I welcomed the New Year while watching a comedy TV program. I feel that it&amp;rsquo;s very happy to greet the New Year while laughing.
Unfortunately, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the sunrise and Mt.Fuji on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day because of thick cloud. Today we ate Zouni as brunch. My wife cooked Hakata Zouni which is localized in Hakata region. It contains Mochi, Katsuona(a kind of leaf mustard), Buri(a yellowtail fish), and etc. It&amp;rsquo;s really tasty, I like it.</description>

      <description>Today I and my wife ate Toshikoshi-soba for lunch. My wife cooked it for us. Eating toshikoshi-soba is the traditional custom in Japan. We Japanese wish healthful long life and eat it on new year&amp;rsquo;s eve. The long soba noodles symbolize a long life. The buckwheat plant can survive severe weather during growing period, so that soba represents strength and resiliency.
After lunch, I went surfing. There were fine waves and I enjoyed.</description>

I went to America on my way of honeymoon. I wanted to introduce my wife to my brother&amp;rsquo;s family. And I&amp;rsquo;d like to eat American and Canadian foods, and see the Niagara falls again.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been there with my dad and mom three years ago. It was an amazing experience, but it was not enough to visit there only once.</description>

I started to work with a new team that was developing applications of IoT and Cloud. If I can use and manage kubernetes and docker smoothly, I think if I can make a contribute to the team, I can transfer to the team.</description>

And I went surfing. There were comfortable waves and I could enjoy surfing.

I think that I ought to study English everyday. Everyday. Christmas and New year&amp;rsquo;s days are no exception. If I really want to learn English conversation and work abroad or at a japan branch of foreign distribution company, I must study English everyday.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time when I played a trick on someone. Well, when I was a child, I and my friends were going back home from elementary school.
I caught a small frog and put it on the shoulder of my friend without being noticed.</description>

      <description>Today I went to another ophthalmic clinic.
Two weeks ago, I went to a ophthalmic clinic, because I see a small circle for an instant in my right eye when I blink. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of shadow that I see after I see a bright small light. I was worried about my eyes, however, the doctor couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the reason. The doctor said, &amp;ldquo;There is no problem now, come again a month later&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I practiced delivering my experience and making a question. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly, and I took time to deliver my experience. It was difficult to organize thoughts first before delivering. I felt I had to respond quickly, on the contrary I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my words. Or I found only meaning less words.
Calm down, chill out, take it easy, Naoki. Nobody blame you. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to feel nervous.</description>

At the previous lesson, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep discussing about a community event. This time I did. I was relieved to be able to do that. I was a bit nervous before the last lesson. But I did and I got a bit confidence about English conversation.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve got to make up my mind what I should do in the Cloud development team. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about building the development and operating environment of Machine-Learning with AWS and Jetson Nano.</description>

Who&amp;rsquo;s going to do what? 1. When is the event going to be? Where? What time? We&amp;rsquo;d better hold the event during summer vacation. Because adults can take day-off easily.
We might want to hold the event from 5pm to 8pm. Because children had better sleep early, not staying up late at night.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s for preventing from that. Cathy said that in Philippines we slap the person who grinds teeth in a sleep. Oh, my gosh. I won&amp;rsquo;t tell that to my wife.
And I went to a ophthalmic clinic for the first time. I have never been to a ophthalmic clinic, because I have good eyes.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s English lesson, I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event. I tried that, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do well at all. I think, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time. I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English. So, I can&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly in English about a theme which I&amp;rsquo;ve never think about. I&amp;rsquo;ve read books about how to study English before.</description>

And, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to use phrases below.
 I&amp;rsquo;d better go. I&amp;rsquo;ve got to get going. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to run. Can I call you back? I&amp;rsquo;ll call you later.</description>

      <description>Touchstone-3 Unit-6: Managing life Lesson D: Less is more 1. Reading A. Do you ever multitask? What kinds of things do you do at the same time? Is multitasking a good thing to do? About 20 years ago, when I was at network operation team in the previous company, I sometimes did multitask.
When I was in a network trouble, I&amp;rsquo;ve done multitask. It was calling customer, solving the problems, writing the report, asking my colleague to help me by a chat tool, and explaining that to my boss at the same time.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson.
I learned about the difference between assertive and aggressive. Assertive means that you are confident and say clearly what you think or what you want without attacking someone. It&amp;rsquo;s polite and positive. Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly, but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.
And, I learned about phone conversation. When you call someone, first, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc. Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m fine, but sleepy today. Because at the last dinner I ate and drank too much, so that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep well last night. I ate Caesar salad, bean sprouts salad, Caprese, Lotus root tempura, lamb stew and Matsumae-Zuke, and drank tasty sake. The sake was brewed by Kumazawa brewery that is located in Fujisawa City. I like the sake of Kumazawa brewery and often buy it.
Yesterday, my wife was day-off and she likes cooking, so that she cooked too much.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&amp;rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&amp;rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.</description>

      <description>At the last weekend, I went to the dental clinic. It was the fourth time cleaning. The rest is two times. In addition, I had my mouth shaped to make a mouthpiece. Because I sometimes grind my teeth while sleeping. If I use it, I can prevent teeth grinding.
And I went to Costco, American big supermarket. I bought a lot, and salted herring roe. It is often put in New Year dishes.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, at the English conversation lesson, I learned about grammar for advisable, necessary, and preferable.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t speak smoothly at all. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my words and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say what I wanted to say. The teacher told me to speak a lot and not to overthink, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I should say. What do I have to do to speak a lot and smoothly, not to overthink? How do I study English to do that?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling good very much, today. Because I had a cold the day before yesterday. I had lots of coughs and sneezes. So, yesterday I took a morning day-off and went to a clinic to get a cold medicine. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve got better, but not perfect.
The reason which I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a whole day-off yesterday was that I was going to have to have a meeting with a boss of other department related with Machine Learning.</description>

You use &amp;ldquo;do the math&amp;rdquo;, when you do easy addition or subtraction. On the other hand, you use &amp;ldquo;calculate&amp;rdquo;, when you use a numerical expression.
And newly wed. It&amp;rsquo;s me. It means a person who got married recently. I told my teacher that I&amp;rsquo;ve got married this March and when and where I and my wife met for the first time, so she said to me, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a newly wed!</description>

Today, I&amp;rsquo;m sleepy, because I had many coughs last night. I&amp;rsquo;ve had taken some cold medicines, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. I need a medicine stopping coughs.

The reason is that my department decided to quit Machine Learning Project that I participate in. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the true reason. But I suppose that because it takes long time to accomplish the goal. I was so disappointed with that, because I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying Machine Learning.</description>

Therefore, he said that you should be better to work at other department related with Machine Learning. Fortunately, the boss of my boss previously lead the center that contains the department related with Machine Learning.</description>

      <description>I have teamed up with three others for three months to tackle the training exercise about Machine Learning. Today, I went to Osaka to give the presentation about its results. I think that it was successful because we could answer some questions and the audience responded well. I submit the report and the source codes in a month, the training will be completed.
However, I must use what I learned in the training for my work.</description>

      <description>This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s lunch was ramen as shown in the photo. I ate Deluxe Vege Ramen. It had some corns, a boiled eggs flavored with soy sauce and other seasonings, Chinese bamboo shoots, and two slices of roast pork. It was really delicious. I will visit the ramen restaurant again, definitely.
And then, I and my wife went to Costco at Zama-City. We bought several bottles of sparking wines, some vegetables, lots of meats:Sausages, Pork ribs, chicken wings, chicken breast, minced beef, and shoulder loin beef.</description>

      <description>Today, I had my teeth deep cleaned at a dental clinic near my house. It was for the first time in 5 or 6 years, because it&amp;rsquo;s little bit painful and a bother. I don&amp;rsquo;t like anesthetic injections into the gums. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt so much because the surface anesthesia is done first. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t like teeth cleaning because it spends time. Normally it spends 4 weeks or 6 weeks.</description>

      <description>In the previous lesson, I studied about healthy food and told what is in my fridge. And I gave my opinions for some beliefs about food.
One of beliefs what I heard of is that eating a bowl of salad at the beginning of a meal can give you a feeling of fullness and prevent overeating. And also chewing 30 times per mouth can prevent overeating.
In these days, I always overeat at dinner, so from now on I&amp;rsquo;ll do those methods.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling well recently. I have a runny nose and lots of sneeze, and I&amp;rsquo;m dull. I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably because of air conditioning during sleep.
However, I can&amp;rsquo;t stop the air conditioner while sleeping. If I do that, I will get heat stroke.</description>

The doctor who mainly operated the surgery told us that the bleeding didn&amp;rsquo;t stop for a while and he hesitated to continue operating. Fortunately, the bleeding stopped and he continued. That is the reason that it took long time.
Moreover, he said that this cancer might have metastasized to the liver.</description>

      <description>1. This summer I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to This summer I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to learn algebra and statistics.
I learned algebra and statistics when I was in high school and university, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t used them very much recently. Because I used to use sophisticated software libraries, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to use them.
However, I have to use them from now on to understand the theory of machine learning and deep learning.</description>

      <description>How to make a conversation longer. The best way to show that you want to start a longer conversation is to ask open-ended questions. Open-ended questions have to be answered with more than one word and allow the other person to talk longer.
 1. Open-ended questions  What do you think about hoge? Have you heard that hoge? : (If they answer &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;: ) What do you think? What do you like about hoge?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying a development environment for AI(ML/DL). I haven&amp;rsquo;t studied AI itself yet. Despite that, there are too many things I don&amp;rsquo;t know and I have a lot to learn.
It feels so good to know what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. There are many such moments since I started studying AI.
It feels so good to try new things at any age.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll take it easy. I think it&amp;rsquo;s the most efficient to work hard at ease. Don&amp;rsquo;t take it too seriously.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m going to buy a new queen size bed and a good mattress to sleep well.</description>

      <description>I had trouble falling asleep last night. Because It was hot and humid night.
I heard that the function of the brain is blunted like drunken if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough sleep.
That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t concentrate.
In these day, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of buying a bigger bed that is comfortable to sleep.</description>

      <description>I was thinking of surfing today as I did yesterday. So I went to surf. But, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t surf, I was almost drown.
The low pressure made strong onshore winds and high waves, making it difficult for me to surf. They disturbed me trying to go outside.
The wind was weak early in the morning, so I wish I had gone surfing at that time.
In the afternoon, I watched a drama broadcasted on NETFLIX.</description>

We went to three Izakaya bars. In Noge, there are many Izakaya bars, so people go to some Izakaya bars to enjoy various dishes and drinks.
One of our friends traveled to Spain for a week in early June. She gave us some presents. We were very happy.</description>

The weather was so fine and hot today. It&amp;rsquo;s a season that requires air conditioning.
I will go surfing tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Today, I spent a depraved day. I watched anime all day long. It was One punch man.
This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.</description>

      <description>On Father&amp;rsquo;s day, my family ate eel. I love eels very much. Eel is just awesome.
Sadly, however, the number of eels has been decreasing. It&amp;rsquo;s said that the reasons are overfishing and environmental change.
Since the ecology of eels isn&amp;rsquo;t known yet, complete eel farming is difficult.
Even now, research on complete eel farming is being continued, and it is said that it may be successful with a little more.</description>

      <description>Today I came back to my parent&amp;rsquo;s home. Because my brother who lives in America was going back to my parent&amp;rsquo;s home. We had happy family reunion on Father&amp;rsquo;s day.
But there was also sad news. My brother&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rsquo;s father had stomach cancer and colon cancer. He had surgery to remove his cancer, and had been in the hospital for a month. It was last December. He didn&amp;rsquo;t inform his daughter that he had surgery so as not to make her worry.</description>

      <description>Today, I attneded AWS Summit Tokyo 2019: the final day. I used the Shonan Liner and the limited express Wakashio this morning, too. It was so comfortable that I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine coming to Kaihin Makuhari without getting on the express.
Keynote (10:00-11:30) It was the almost same as the Day 1&amp;rsquo;s keynote. Furthermore, the presenter talked too much and it was overtime. Panasonic&amp;rsquo;s speech wasn&amp;rsquo;t good neither.
 [初級] AWS コンテナサービス入門 (12:00-12:40) The presenter talked very well, so I could understand about the AWS Container Services.</description>

Keynote (10:00-11:30) The music was loud at the venue and it was like rock concert, so I was a little excited. The opening of keynote was started with movies and dance. It&amp;rsquo;s completely concert.
In this AWS Summit Tokyo 2019, 33,000+ have been registered. AWS has 50% share in cloud business, it&amp;rsquo;s great.</description>

      <description>Today I watched Friends after a long time, because I thought that I could learn daily conversation by wathing this movie.
In NETFLIX, I can download its movies, so I can watch them during commuting.
To learn daily conversation, I will watch it twice each time. The first time, I watch it in Japanese with English caption to know what each its quotes mean. The second time, I watch it in English with English caption, so I learn pronunciation and expressions in English.</description>

      <description>I registered to NETFLIX, because it displays movie&amp;rsquo;s caption in English. To study English in a fun way, it&amp;rsquo;s good for me to watch movies in English. My favorite movie is &amp;ldquo;You vs. Wild&amp;rdquo; featuring Bear Grylls.
NETFLIX is free for the first month, so during the period I will try to find out if NETFLIX is useful to studying English.
I like movies very much, so &amp;ldquo;what one likes, one will do well.</description>

      <description>Today, I surfed in this morning and this evening. The waves size are from shoulder to head, it&amp;rsquo;s high for me. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to getting out to out-side.
I rode waves only a few times, and wiped out many times. The sea is fairly cold that I might caught a bit cold. Still, I enjoyed surfing very much and I will keep surfing.</description>

      <description>My goal through my life is to be a &amp;ldquo;master of life&amp;rdquo;. The word, &amp;ldquo;master of life&amp;rdquo;, was told in the comic &amp;ldquo;Master Keaton&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;Master of life&amp;rdquo; is a person who lives life in his own way and always has the life of his own colour. &amp;ldquo;Master Keaton vol.7&amp;rdquo; Chapter 3, page.79
It&amp;rsquo;s my goal, but I have not reached there at all. But I believe I will be able to become &amp;ldquo;master of life&amp;rdquo; someday, if I can continue studying for a lifetime.</description>

Why ? Because, he works as a engineer in America. I also want to work as a engineer in America or Europe. I envy him working abroad and I&amp;rsquo;m proud of him.</description>

I have jogged along Shonan Coast for the first time in two weeks this evening.
The weather was a bit cloudy, but it was very nice.
I think I have to do exercise, because I have been gaining weight from before, I will continue to jog from now on.</description>

      <description>AWS DeepRace League - Technical Workdshop Yesterday, I joined the &amp;ldquo;AWS Deep Racer League - Technical Workhop&amp;rdquo;, because I wanted to have fun learning about machine learning. The AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&amp;rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It&amp;rsquo;s the Softech&amp;rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7&amp;rsquo;0&amp;rdquo;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How to build your confidence - and spark it others&amp;rdquo; I lose my confidence when I fail and disappointed myself,
when I was given cold stares, when I was blamed, and
when I was ignored.
This TED talk, Ms. Brittany Packnett&amp;rsquo;s speech, gives me a confidence.
It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.
 Impressed words  Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it.</description>

London is a huge and advanced city, however, London has buildings from the Middle Ages. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing and attractive city.
Shopping We haven&amp;rsquo;t decided what to buy as gifts yet, so we were going to go window-shopping at Soho and Regent Street.</description>

This time, however, immigration officers are very kind. Moreover, my wife said &amp;ldquo;This is our honeymoon&amp;rdquo; then, they said to us &amp;ldquo;Conguraturations!&amp;rdquo; with smile.
Tube We went to the center of London city by Tube: it&amp;rsquo;s subway in London. To ride Tube, we bought Oyster card at the station.</description>
