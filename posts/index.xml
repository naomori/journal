      <description>I worked from home today. I had written documents for my software about its architecture, usage, how to build and installation.
The reason what I worked from home today was that the typhoon was supposed to come. But it went to somewhere. There were no winds, no heavy rain and no lightning.
The weather was so fine and hot today. It&amp;rsquo;s a season that requires air conditioning.
I will go surfing tomorrow.</description>

      <description>I got an English lesson today. I had a quiz that you make one word by choosing two memos from the ones with one word.
 back pack butter fly light house blue berry etc.  I thought it&amp;rsquo;s easy, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find some words. I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough vocabulary.
The followings will be my homework by next Friday.

      <description>Today is sunny weather during the rainy season. The air temperature is high and humidity is also high, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s better than a rainy day.
Apart from that, Zozomat was announced. It measures your foot shape three-dimensionally in millimeters.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great innovation because I have had several mistakes in selecting shoes. It will be delivered this winter, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it.</description>

      <description>Today, I spent a depraved day. I watched anime all day long. It was One punch man.
This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.</description>

      <description>On Father&amp;rsquo;s day, my family ate eel. I love eels very much. Eel is just awesome.
Sadly, however, the number of eels has been decreasing. It&amp;rsquo;s said that the reasons are overfishing and environmental change.
Since the ecology of eels isn&amp;rsquo;t known yet, complete eel farming is difficult.
Even now, research on complete eel farming is being continued, and it is said that it may be successful with a little more.</description>

      <description>Today I came back to my parent&amp;rsquo;s home. Because my brother who lives in America was going back to my parent&amp;rsquo;s home. We had happy family reunion on Father&amp;rsquo;s day.
But there was also sad news. My brother&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rsquo;s father had stomach cancer and colon cancer. He had surgery to remove his cancer, and had been in the hospital for a month. It was last December. He didn&amp;rsquo;t inform his daughter that he had surgery so as not to make her worry.</description>

      <description>Today, I attneded AWS Summit Tokyo 2019: the final day. I used the Shonan Liner and the limited express Wakashio this morning, too. It was so comfortable that I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine coming to Kaihin Makuhari without getting on the express.
Keynote (10:00-11:30) It was the almost same as the Day 1&amp;rsquo;s keynote. Furthermore, the presenter talked too much and it was overtime. Panasonic&amp;rsquo;s speech wasn&amp;rsquo;t good neither.
[初級] AWS コンテナサービス入門 (12:00-12:40) The presenter talked very well, so I could understand about the AWS Container Services.</description>

XR represents Virtual Reality(VR), Augmented Reality(AR), and Mixed Reality(MR). A presenter said that the XR Application developed by Sumerian works on various environments.</description>

      <description>I attended AWS Summit Tokyo 2019 today. It will be held in 3 days. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna attend it every days.
Keynote (10:00-11:30) The music was loud at the venue and it was like rock concert, so I was a little excited. The opening of keynote was started with movies and dance. It&amp;rsquo;s completely concert.
In this AWS Summit Tokyo 2019, 33,000+ have been registered. AWS has 50% share in cloud business, it&amp;rsquo;s great.</description>

      <description>Today I watched Friends after a long time, because I thought that I could learn daily conversation by wathing this movie.
In NETFLIX, I can download its movies, so I can watch them during commuting.
To learn daily conversation, I will watch it twice each time. The first time, I watch it in Japanese with English caption to know what each its quotes mean. The second time, I watch it in English with English caption, so I learn pronunciation and expressions in English.</description>

      <description>I registered to NETFLIX, because it displays movie&amp;rsquo;s caption in English. To study English in a fun way, it&amp;rsquo;s good for me to watch movies in English. My favorite movie is &amp;ldquo;You vs. Wild&amp;rdquo; featuring Bear Grylls.
NETFLIX is free for the first month, so during the period I will try to find out if NETFLIX is useful to studying English.
I like movies very much, so &amp;ldquo;what one likes, one will do well.</description>

      <description>Today, I surfed in this morning and this evening. The waves size are from shoulder to head, it&amp;rsquo;s high for me. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to getting out to out-side.
I rode waves only a few times, and wiped out many times. The sea is fairly cold that I might caught a bit cold. Still, I enjoyed surfing very much and I will keep surfing.</description>

      <description>My goal through my life is to be a &amp;ldquo;master of life&amp;rdquo;. The word, &amp;ldquo;master of life&amp;rdquo;, was told in the comic &amp;ldquo;Master Keaton&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;Master of life&amp;rdquo; is a person who lives life in his own way and always has the life of his own colour. &amp;ldquo;Master Keaton vol.7&amp;rdquo; Chapter 3, page.79
It&amp;rsquo;s my goal, but I have not reached there at all. But I believe I will be able to become &amp;ldquo;master of life&amp;rdquo; someday, if I can continue studying for a lifetime.</description>

I have jogged along Shonan Coast for the first time in two weeks this evening.
The weather was a bit cloudy, but it was very nice.
I think I have to do exercise, because I have been gaining weight from before, I will continue to jog from now on.</description>

      <description>AWS DeepRace League - Technical Workdshop Yesterday, I joined the &amp;ldquo;AWS Deep Racer League - Technical Workhop&amp;rdquo;, because I wanted to have fun learning about machine learning. The AWS DeepRacer is a 1&amp;frasl;18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&amp;rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It&amp;rsquo;s the Softech&amp;rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7&amp;rsquo;0&amp;rdquo;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How to build your confidence - and spark it others&amp;rdquo; I lose my confidence when I fail and disappointed myself,
when I was given cold stares, when I was blamed, and
when I was ignored.
This TED talk, Ms. Brittany Packnett&amp;rsquo;s speech, gives me a confidence.
It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.
Impressed words  Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it.</description>

      <description> English Breakfast I ate English breakfast in England for the first time. It was lovely delicious.
Afternoon tea At last I had an afternoon tea in England. The tea is lovely tasty, and scones with plenty of clotted cream too. I enjoyed the afternoon tea.

      <description>Take a walk in London We had a little bit jet lag, so we were going to relax and take a walk in London. And we&amp;rsquo;d like to buy gifts in return.
London is a huge and advanced city, however, London has buildings from the Middle Ages. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing and attractive city.
Shopping We haven&amp;rsquo;t decided what to buy as gifts yet, so we were going to go window-shopping at Soho and Regent Street.</description>

      <description>Immigration I got a little bit nervous at immigration, because I usually get asked many questions at the immigration examination and I can&amp;rsquo;t answer well.
This time, however, immigration officers are very kind. Moreover, my wife said &amp;ldquo;This is our honeymoon&amp;rdquo; then, they said to us &amp;ldquo;Conguraturations!&amp;rdquo; with smile.
Tube We went to the center of London city by Tube: it&amp;rsquo;s subway in London. To ride Tube, we bought Oyster card at the station.</description>
