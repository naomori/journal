      <description>I took an English conversation lesson, it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I came back from my honeymoon.
I have visited England, Scotland, Canada and America in my honeymoon, so I thought that my English skill improve a little bit maybe, but it&amp;rsquo;s not at all.
I will study English harder than before so I can work abroad. Of course, I want to enjoy studying English. It&amp;rsquo;s said, &amp;ldquo;what one likes, one will do well.</description>

      <description>I bought this class a year ago, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been studying python so much recently. I&amp;rsquo;ll try learning python again for improving my programming skill.
This class is very good and reasonable price. I think it fits people who want to study python for the first time. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s fun for me to study python. I&amp;rsquo;ll learn python in a fun way from now on.
The progress of studying python is managed by the following github.</description>

      <description>I wanted to surf if the waves were high, but today the waves were too small to surf.
I have jogged along Shonan Coast for the first time in two weeks this evening.
The weather was a bit cloudy, but it was very nice.
I think I have to do exercise, because I have been gaining weight from before, I will continue to jog from now on.</description>

      <description>AWS DeepRace League - Technical Workdshop Yesterday, I joined the &amp;ldquo;AWS Deep Racer League - Technical Workhop&amp;rdquo;, because I wanted to have fun learning about machine learning. The AWS DeepRacer is a 1&amp;frasl;18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&amp;rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It&amp;rsquo;s the Softech&amp;rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7&amp;rsquo;0&amp;rdquo;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How to build your confidence - and spark it others&amp;rdquo; I lose my confidence when I fail and disappointed myself,
when I was given cold stares, when I was blamed, and
when I was ignored.
This TED talk, Ms. Brittany Packnett&amp;rsquo;s speech, gives me a confidence.
It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.
Impressed words  Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it.</description>

      <description>Immigration I got a little bit nervous at immigration, because I usually get asked many questions at the immigration examination and I can&amp;rsquo;t answer well.
This time, however, immigration officers are very kind. Moreover, my wife said &amp;ldquo;This is our honeymoon&amp;rdquo; then, they said to us &amp;ldquo;Conguraturations!&amp;rdquo; with smile.
Tube We went to the center of London city by Tube: it&amp;rsquo;s subway in London. To ride Tube, we bought Oyster card at the station.</description>
