<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>I was cloudy and comfortable temperature today.
I worked from home as usual.
I had nothing special, just worked.
In these days I do jogging or surfing every day, so I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>By the way, iPhone 12 was announced today.<br>
It&rsquo;s good, however I&rsquo;m not going to replace my iPhone.
Because I&rsquo;m satisfied with my iPhone X, moreover new iPhone is very expensive.
In addition, I stay home most of the day, so I don&rsquo;t use my phone very much.
Instead of new iPhone, I want to new iPad.
I&rsquo;d like to use new iPad with an apple pencil for study English.
I can use marker pen with the new iPad and an apple pencil.
I suppose I can study English more effectively.
Also, I can read books and paint a picture on it.
And then I can manage it as digital data.</p>
