What does it mean leading people? Leading people means that you have a clear vision of a world that does not exist, a world that could exist, and by articulating the cause of the vision and the purpose over and over again. It inspires people who believe what you believe, who want to see that world built to join to go with you to figure out ways." />

<p>Leading people means that you have a clear vision of a world that does not exist, a world that could exist, and by articulating the cause of the vision and the purpose over and over again.
It inspires people who believe what you believe, who want to see that world built to join to go with you to figure out ways.</p>

<p><strong>Leadership is not a rank.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leadership is not a position.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leadership is a decision.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leadership is a choice.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;re the problem</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look after people around you, you become a leader.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you&rsquo;re the problem.
They blame everything else except themselves.
His point is take accountability for your actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>

</ul>
<p>If you want to be a elite warrior,
it&rsquo;s not about how tough you are,
it&rsquo;s not about how smart you are,
or it&rsquo;s not about fast you are.
You&rsquo;d better get really good at helping people around you.
That&rsquo;s how people advance in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Good at helping people</strong></p>
</li>

</ul>
<p>Leaders have followers who go where the leaders are going.
Leaders have followers who go in the direction that the leaders are pointing.</p>
<p>To lead others means that you have a clear vision of a world that does not yet exist, a world that could exist.
Leadership means is articulating this world in which the vast majority of us is.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I love my job</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Working hard for something we don&rsquo;t care about is called stress.
Working hard for something we love is called passion.</p>
<p>Every person on the planet has passion.
We just don&rsquo;t all have passion for the same thing.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-couldt-say-but-i-wanted">What I could&rsquo;t say but I wanted</h2>
<p>Japanese government declared the third state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo.
I live in Kanagawa prefecture next to Tokyo, so I don&rsquo;t have any restrictions.
However, I&rsquo;m bit worried about many people who visit Kanagawa from Tokyo.
Because I live near the tourist spot, Enoshima island.
I suppose that a lot of tourists will visit Enoshima during Golden week.</p>
<p>By the way, a teacher said that she needs to have a pass which allows her to go out when the city is lockdown.
Even if she just exercises or goes shopping, she needs it.
In Japan, the government has no power to force people to stay at home, they can only just ask people to act with moral.
That&rsquo;s because America which defeated Japan at World War 2 built constitution to make the government not to have strong power.
And Japanese keep it for a long time because they also don&rsquo;t want to start and attend any war.</p>
<h2 id="notes-i-should-care-about-the-following-things-when-i-answer-questions">Notes: I should care about the following things when I answer questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>I should write down notes during listening to a speech according to 5W1H.</li>
<li>I should practice more speaking at least two sentences every my turn in a conversation.</li>
<li>I should use OREO in order to avoid circling thought when I deliver my opinion.</li>
<li>I should use various synonyms, not using same words.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="today">Today</h1>
<p>Yesterday, I took a walk to the nearest shrine and worshiped it with my wife.
And we explored our town and found a cafe or shop we didn&rsquo;t know.
Although we lived for four years in this town, we don&rsquo;t know many things.
It&rsquo;s fun to find something new.</p>
