<p>It&rsquo;s raining today again.</p>

<p>Last night, May beetle was sticking to my cloth that was hanging out.</p>

<p>Summer is coming.</p>

<hr />

<p>The followings is my homework by next Wednesday.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t hear some of what they said.
I should ask my teacher about them.</p>

<h2 id="page-9-lesson-d-2-listening">page.9: Lesson-D 2.Listening</h2>

<p>Listen to five people talk about themselves.
Match the people and the things they will probably say next.</p>

<h5 id="1-ana">1. Ana</h5>

<p>I started lessons when I was in elementary school.
I had practiced everyday.
My parents were incredibly strict about that.
But at least I didn&rsquo;t pressure me about anything else.
I guess they thought I was pretty talented.
I mean everyone said I had beautiful voice.
So, yeah, now I&rsquo;m in a local choir and we perform in competitions.
And sometimes, I perform at wedding and things.
I guess &hellip;</p>

<h5 id="2-kevin-i-speak-two-languages-english-and-japanese-fluently">2. Kevin: I speak two languages (English and Japanese) fluently</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s extremely useful, I think.
I mean <strong>??we&rsquo;ll new??</strong> go for a job, it&rsquo;s a good skill to say you have.
I was incredibly lucky, though.
Because my mom&rsquo;s from Japan.
So, she spoke to me all the time in Japanese, when I was little.
So, that helped a lot.
And I think I have a pretty good ear.
I find it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to learn new words.
I mean I can pick up vocabulary pretty easily.
So, yeah, I want to learn Mandarin Chinese.
But, for now, I can say &hellip;</p>

<h5 id="3-jen-i-m-extremely-allergic-to-nuts">3. Jen: I&rsquo;m extremely allergic to nuts.</h5>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s started when I was just a little kid.
My parents gave me some to eat, and I got really sick.
At first we didn&rsquo;t know why, but now I know why
<strong>it can&rsquo;t automatically just have a cookie or anything.</strong>
Like I&rsquo;m always asking &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in it&rdquo; or &ldquo;what&rsquo;s made from&rdquo; especially at restaurant.
But at least I know what problem is.
So, yeah, &hellip;</p>

<h5 id="4-patrick-i-can-play-two-instruments-tin-whistle-flute-really-well">4. Patrick: I can play two instruments(Tin whistle??, flute) really well.</h5>

<p>I fell in love with it, when I was really young.
My Dad was always taking me to hear Irish music,
and I thought it absolutely wonderful.
And on my birthday, he knew exactly what I want, and he got it for me.
Of course, it took for a while to learn to play it properly.
It&rsquo;s incredibly difficult.
But after couple of years of lessons, I got pretty good at it.
That later on, I got flute, too.
So, now &hellip;</p>

<h5 id="5-tom-i-m-a-pretty-good-cook">5. Tom: I&rsquo;m a pretty good cook.</h5>

<p>I like all kinds, Mexican, French, Chinese.
I&rsquo;m always trying out new things.
Like last week, I&rsquo;ve ate spicy Vietnamese, absolutely fantastic.
I mean I&rsquo;m not professional or anything, but I&rsquo;m fairly good at it.
Sometimes I have friends over for dinner, and they think it&rsquo;s really amazing.
Some of them didn&rsquo;t know about my hobby before.
They&rsquo;re amazed. So, yeah &hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="page-9-lesson-d-3-writing-and-speaking">page.9: Lesson-D 3.Writing and speaking</h2>

<h4 id="a-write-a-profile-about-yourself">A. Write a profile about yourself.</h4>

<h5 id="1-where-are-you-based">1. Where are you based ?</h5>

<p>In Fujisawa-City, Kanagawa.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Ise-City, Mie.
At the age of 18, I went to university in Osaka.
After several transfers, I came to Fujisawa.</p>

<h5 id="2-what-s-your-job">2. What&rsquo;s your job ?</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer.
I work for a big company called Hoge corporation.</p>

<p>I moved several times because Hoge corporation has a number of bases in Japan.
Whenever my work changed, my base changed.</p>

<h5 id="3-what-are-your-future-plans">3. What are your future plans ?</h5>

<p>I want to travel around the world and work abroad.
I want to experience other cultures, various landscapes, and delicious local dishes.</p>

<p>Of course, I want to surf at Siargao Island.
But at least I should improve my surfing skill very much.</p>

<h5 id="4-what-do-you-do-in-your-free-time">4. What do you do in your free time ?</h5>

<p>I like surfing and camping.</p>

<p>When I was in Fukuoka, Kyushu, I often went to Hyuga, Miyazaki to camp and surf.
Hyuga has the best campsite to surf.
The campsite was very clean, close to the sea, and close to markets.</p>

<p>And now, in Kanagawa, I&rsquo;ve been to some good campsites near Mt.Fuji.
Those campsites have beautiful lawn and great views.
But I haven&rsquo;t been able to find good campsites to surf.</p>

<h5 id="5-what-s-something-people-don-t-know-about-you">5. What&rsquo;s something people don&rsquo;t know about you ?</h5>

<p>When I was in elementary school and junior high school,
I belonged to the scout association; it&rsquo;s known as Boy Scouts.
So, I love outdoor activities: camping, surfing, and &hellip; zipline.</p>
