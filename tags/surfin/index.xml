      <description>This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s lunch was ramen as shown in the photo. I ate Deluxe Vege Ramen. It had some corns, a boiled eggs flavored with soy sauce and other seasonings, Chinese bamboo shoots, and two slices of roast pork. It was really delicious. I will visit the ramen restaurant again, definitely.
And then, I and my wife went to Costco at Zama-City. We bought several bottles of sparking wines, some vegetables, lots of meats:Sausages, Pork ribs, chicken wings, chicken breast, minced beef, and shoulder loin beef.</description>

      <description>I was thinking of surfing today as I did yesterday. So I went to surf. But, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t surf, I was almost drown.
The low pressure made strong onshore winds and high waves, making it difficult for me to surf. They disturbed me trying to go outside.
The wind was weak early in the morning, so I wish I had gone surfing at that time.
In the afternoon, I watched a drama broadcasted on NETFLIX.</description>

      <description>Today is a relaxing day.
I woke up at 10:00 o&amp;rsquo;clock on a late morning than usual. And then, I sent the packages which at the post office.
I had Taiwan ramen of a restaurant called Misen which is famouse in Nagoya for lunch. It was very hot and tasted wonderful.
After lunch, I took a nap for 1 hour. I went to surfing. The waves wasn&amp;rsquo;t very high, but at least it was just right for me.</description>
