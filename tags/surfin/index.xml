      <description>I was thinking of surfing today as I did yesterday. So I went to surf. But, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t surf, I was almost drown.
The low pressure made strong onshore winds and high waves, making it difficult for me to surf. They disturbed me trying to go outside.
The wind was weak early in the morning, so I wish I had gone surfing at that time.
In the afternoon, I watched a drama broadcasted on NETFLIX.</description>

      <description>Today is a relaxing day.
I woke up at 10:00 o&amp;rsquo;clock on a late morning than usual. And then, I sent the packages which at the post office.
I had Taiwan ramen of a restaurant called Misen which is famouse in Nagoya for lunch. It was very hot and tasted wonderful.
After lunch, I took a nap for 1 hour. I went to surfing. The waves wasn&amp;rsquo;t very high, but at least it was just right for me.</description>
