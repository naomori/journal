      <description>Today is the last day of summer vacation. It was very hot and humid again today. I went to JA to by vegetables and went to a supermarket to buy some foods and drinks in the morning.
I ate Shiroishi-Umen for lunch. I ate it for the first time and it was delicious. The noodles are short and easy to eat, and my wife made the soup for me. It&#39;s so tasty.</description>

      <description>I have been running along the Kugenuma coast. That was the first time in a month. It was very humid and hot, but it was nice to run along the seafront at night.
On the sandy beach, the construction of a sea house was being promoted at night, and I felt the arrival of summer.</description>
