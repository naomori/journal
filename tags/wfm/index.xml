      <description>I worked from home last Friday and yesterday, and I work at the office today, so I came to the office for the first time in 4 days today.
The reason why I came to the office is to access the server with GPU in my company. I want to use it to learn Deep Learning. There is no other reason.
Thus, if I don&#39;t use it, I don&#39;t have to go to the office.</description>

      <description>Typhoon Faxai (Typhoon No.15) came in this morning. It was heavy rain and the wind was blowing hard. All train was stopped until 8 o&#39;clock, so I decided to work from home today. In the Kanto region, there were restrictions on the number of visitors to the stations, and it seemed very crowded.</description>
