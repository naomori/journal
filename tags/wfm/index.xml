      <description>Typhoon Faxai (Typhoon No.15) came in this morning. It was heavy rain and the wind was blowing hard. All train was stopped until 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock, so I decided to work from home today. In the Kanto region, there were restrictions on the number of visitors to the stations, and it seemed very crowded.</description>
