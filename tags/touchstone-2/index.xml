      <description>Unit-1: Making friends Before I begin&amp;hellip; Where do people make friends? People make friends at school, neighbors, club, hobbies, workplace, trip, or somewhere, I guess.
What questions can you ask a new friend about these topics?  School or work  What are you studying? What do you do? What&#39;s your job? Are you a graduated student? Are you a mad scientist?   Home and family  How many siblings do you have?</description>
