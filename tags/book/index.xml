      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished a book, &amp;ldquo;MASTERING CIVILITY&amp;rdquo;. The reason that I wanted to read this book is that I expected it helps me in life. Because I always have at least one rude friend or colleague, so I want to deal with it well.
Even if I belong to any companies or any communities in the future, I must be having at least one rude person, I think.
The book said that if you met rude person in your office, you should care about only yourself and your future.</description>
