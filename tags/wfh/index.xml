      <description>I worked from home today. Working from home, I&amp;rsquo;m glad need not to commute. On fridays, stations are crowded and I don&amp;rsquo;t like that.
If I can, I want to work from home everyday.
 By the way, my credit card was used illegally. Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay for them. However, I have to reissue my credit card so I cannot use it for a while. In addition, I will need to update the credit card information on my various payments.</description>
