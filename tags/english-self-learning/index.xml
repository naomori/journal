      <description>Review 2021/03/16 Lesson What I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say but I wanted to say. Ms.Yvee&amp;rsquo;s heard from her students that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to book her class, she said. I think that&amp;rsquo;s because many of her students chose an online plan. The students who chose the online plan can book only one class. Therefore, they can&amp;rsquo;t book her another class before they finish her class. Accordingly, it&amp;rsquo;s tough to book for her students to book her class on the day which they want to book, I think.</description>

      <description>Writing: Part2 (63, 65, 66) What is your opinion about banning smoking in public?  I agree with banning smoking in public. Because smoking gives both smokers and non-smokers bad effects. For instance, smoke brings a cancer even if non-smokers breath cigarette smoke. Therefore, smokers must smoke in a smoking room, not in public.   Do you think your workplace is woman-friendly?  I don&amp;rsquo;t think my workplace is woman-friendly.</description>
