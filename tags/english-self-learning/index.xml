      <description>Today I worked from home as usual. It&amp;rsquo;s getting dark earlier. Now sunrise is at five thirty and sunset is at around five. By the way, a typhoon is coming. So, waves are getting bigger. It&amp;rsquo;s good to surf. Rainy or sunny doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter for suring. That&amp;rsquo;s the nice thing about surfing. I don&amp;rsquo;t like jogging under rain. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t care about rain during surfing.

      <description>How am I donig today? I&amp;rsquo;m doing good. Last Saturday, I had my hair cut. I feel my head became lighter than before. And it&amp;rsquo;s good for surfing.
Did I mention my plan to go on a trip to Okinawa before? I&amp;rsquo;m decided to go on a trip to Okinawa next January. My wife&amp;rsquo;s birthday is in January. The reason I decided to go on the trip is because I&amp;rsquo;m little bored of staying home and I want to go somewhere with Japanese government support.</description>

 In Singapore, the word &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; is considered impolite.  Yes, it is. Because they will sometimes say &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; to avoid causing offence.   In Greece, you should nod your head upwards to say &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;  No, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. Because the Greeks traditionally nod the head upwards to say &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo;. They use a tilt of the head from side to side to mean &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;.</description>
