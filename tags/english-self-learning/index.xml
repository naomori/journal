      <description>Review 2021/06/09 Lesson - Elective Listening Where do new words come from? - Marcel Danesi
Every year, about 1,000 new words are added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Where do they come from, and how do they make it into our everyday lives?
With over 170,000 words currently in use in the English language, it might seem we already have plenty. Yet, as our world changes, new ideas and inventions spring forth, and science progresses, our existing words leave gaps in what we want to express and we fill those gaps in several ingenious, practical, and occasionally peculiar ways.</description>

      <description>Review 2021/04/09 Lesson 1. a big fish in a little/small pond someone who is important in or who has influence over a very small area
He is a big fish in that community, but he isn&amp;rsquo;t known to everyone in another community. No one is a big fish everywhere, I think.
2. cold fish an unfriendly person who seems to have no strong feelings
I might be a bit cold fish, because I&amp;rsquo;m introverted and a bit shy.</description>

      <description>Writing: Part2(41-43) Are you studying for TOEIC?   I&amp;rsquo;m studying for TOEIC. Because I&amp;rsquo;m planning to change my job in the near future. To do so, I need to make some preparations. For example, I have to pass some certified exams with technical vendors, Cisco, Amazon Web Service or something like that. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;m studying for TOEIC. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that. Because I just want to enjoy trip abroad and catch up with the latest technique of computer science.</description>

I think that&amp;rsquo;s because many of her students chose an online plan. The students who chose the online plan can book only one class. Therefore, they can&amp;rsquo;t book her another class before they finish her class. Accordingly, it&amp;rsquo;s tough to book for her students to book her class on the day which they want to book, I think.</description>

      <description>Review 2020/12/17 lesson: Pronunciation I&amp;rsquo;m not good at telephoning actually. Since my colleagues receive business phone calls thankfully, I usually don&amp;rsquo;t have to receive them. However, sometimes I have to receive a business call. I remember when I received a business call in English. I tried to speak carefully and clearly, but the person on the other end of the line didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to understand much of what I was saying.</description>

Notes There are three points to be improved in this class. First, I ought to speak further. For instance, I should expand my opinion adding reason, examples, or feeling. Second, I&amp;rsquo;d better less thinking time. Because it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to respond quickly in general conversation. Finally, I might want to deliver a topic of small talk spontaneously. I should enjoy a conversation positively, not be always a passive attitude in it.</description>

      <description>Review 10/22 lesson What I wanted to say but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say I would like to make beef brisket using slow cooker. Because the brisket cooked by slow cooker is super soft and juicy.
what I felt difficult Phrasal verbs of &amp;lsquo;make&amp;rsquo; have lots of meanings and it seems that they are used in limited situations. So, it was not easy for me to imagine such situations and make sentences using those idioms at the same time.</description>

In addition, they don&amp;rsquo;t have to stay in big cities any more now. Because they can work from home or attend classes remotely. The experts says this trend is likely to keep staying.</description>

In addition, the rice is polished to remove its surface, as a result it has fruity flavor and soft texture.</description>
