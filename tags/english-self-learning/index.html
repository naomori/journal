      Writing: 23rd February, 2020 - Big breakfasts help us burn double the calories Discussion  a) What do you think of your weight?  I think I would better reduce my weight. Because my weight is heavier than the average people who are the same height as I. However, in my opinion, even if you have more weight, it&rsquo;s good provided that you&rsquo;re healthy and feeling good. Because it&rsquo;s important not only to be physical healthy but also mental healthy.

 In Singapore, the word &lsquo;no&rsquo; is considered impolite.  Yes, it is. Because they will sometimes say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to avoid causing offence.   In Greece, you should nod your head upwards to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;  No, you shouldn&rsquo;t. Because the Greeks traditionally nod the head upwards to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;. They use a tilt of the head from side to side to mean &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.

Why did the current prime minister of Japan quit? It&rsquo;s because he has a health problem and it has been worse, so he decided not to keep his post. He has been the prime minister before at once, it was fourteen years ago. He resigned from his post at that time because of his health problem. That is, he resigned twice from the prime minister.

Firstly, the air cargo industry have no experience that deliver 8,000 flights at once. Scientists says that to transport the vaccine across the globe will require around 8,000 flight planes.

      Review the previous lesson(9/11) If you were to travel this year, where would you like to go? If I were to travel this year, I&rsquo;d like to go to Iceland. Because Iceland has great nature. For instance it has volcanoes, glaciers, fiord, and aurora. Therefore, I want to go on a trip to Iceland, I can&rsquo;t go there now due to COVID-19, though.
How about if you have these four choices, which would you choose?
