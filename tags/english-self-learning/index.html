      Writing Part 2: 29-31 What do you do on arrival at work?  I always turn on my computer. I don&rsquo;t commute to work though. However, I always turn it on for working. Because I&rsquo;m a software engineer, so I need to use it anyway.   Talk about a shop or restaurant you often go to in your neighborhood.  The restaurant in my neighborhood serves delicious beer and sake.

Mochi is basically made of rice for Mochi. You steam the rice and pound it with a pestle until it becomes sticky. It&rsquo;s done. You made Mochi. On the other hand, Mochi desserts are made from a variety of ingredients. For example, fruit, bean paste, ice cream, vegetables and Mochi.

      Writing: Part2 (17-19) Talk about a person who you care about very much.  I&rsquo;m taking care of my wife. Because she had a serious disease three years ago. The disease occurs in about three people per one hundred thousand people. She had a surgery to get rid of the tumor and all of the rectum to prevent the disease metastasis. Therefore, she&rsquo;s physically weak and I care about her.   What and when do you have breakfast?

Today I&rsquo;d like to speak about Mochi desserts.
Because Ise city, which is my hometown, has a variety of Mochi desserts and I&rsquo;d like you to know my hometown&rsquo;s speciality.

I can remember and use them naturally using them frequently.  How are older people viewed in my country? Elderly people are basically respected in Japan. Because Confucianism affected Japanese for a long time. In fact, Japan has the &ldquo;Respect for the aged day&rdquo; as a national holiday.

Create a short paragraph about my hobby and wish My hobby is mainly surfing. I&rsquo;m a big fan of surfing because I feel nature power and the smooth surface of the wave during riding waves. My wife and I used to go camping before this pandemic, however in these days we don&rsquo;t. Because nowadays many campers go camping, so campsites is very crowded.

      Review 11/27 lesson: Discussion How To Create A Career
Notes There are three points to be improved in this class. First, I ought to speak further. For instance, I should expand my opinion adding reason, examples, or feeling. Second, I&rsquo;d better less thinking time. Because it&rsquo;s necessary to respond quickly in general conversation. Finally, I might want to deliver a topic of small talk spontaneously. I should enjoy a conversation positively, not be always a passive attitude in it.

The tests were part of a joint project by Tel Aviv University and the Shamir Medical Center. The researchers said the science behind their experiments was very simple - they used only oxygen to slow down and turn around what happens to cells as they age.

Summary Residents of Tokyo who moved out of the capital outnumbered those who moved in after this pandemic. On the other hand, the opposite happened in local cities. Because people was afraid of infection with coronavirus.
In addition, they don&rsquo;t have to stay in big cities any more now. Because they can work from home or attend classes remotely. The experts says this trend is likely to keep staying.

You can drink several types of sake and beer that the brewery made. I like sake especially &ldquo;Junmai Ginjo&rdquo; because it smells good and tasty. &ldquo;Junmai Ginjo&rdquo; means that the sake is made of rice, malted rice and water. In addition, the rice is polished to remove its surface, as a result it has fruity flavor and soft texture.
