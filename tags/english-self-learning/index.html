I can remember and use them naturally using them frequently.  How are older people viewed in my country? Elderly people are basically respected in Japan. Because Confucianism affected Japanese for a long time. In fact, Japan has the &ldquo;Respect for the aged day&rdquo; as a national holiday.

      Review 11/27 lesson: Discussion How To Create A Career
Notes There are three points to be improved in this class. First, I ought to speak further. For instance, I should expand my opinion adding reason, examples, or feeling. Second, I&rsquo;d better less thinking time. Because it&rsquo;s necessary to respond quickly in general conversation. Finally, I might want to deliver a topic of small talk spontaneously. I should enjoy a conversation positively, not be always a passive attitude in it.

Have you ever been stuck in a traffic? Yes, I have. I&rsquo;ve been stuck in a traffic during consecutive holidays. Because there are several consecutive holidays in Japan. As the result, many Japanese go on a trip at the same time. Once you were caught in a traffic jam, you can&rsquo;t pick up the speed and you have to inch along even if you were in a hurry.

      Writing: Scientists say they can reverse ageing process - 25th November, 2020 Scientists in Israel say they have conducted tests to successfully stop and reverse the biological ageing process. The tests were part of a joint project by Tel Aviv University and the Shamir Medical Center. The researchers said the science behind their experiments was very simple - they used only oxygen to slow down and turn around what happens to cells as they age.

      Review 11/24 lesson Homework: make sentences using at least 4 phrasal verbs about cleaning When I was a child, I was not good at clearing up my room. Contrarily, my mother is neat and tidy, so she couldn&rsquo;t stand my dirty room. Thus, she often told me to tidy up my room and sweep it up at least once a week. Now I am better organized than before. I always hang up my jacket when I come back, so my clothes are never jumbled up on the floor or the bed.

Nabe is a stew and soup served in winter, and the dish is frequently cooked at the table. The diners can pick the cooked ingredients they want from the pot. The family can spend wonderful time through Nabe. On the other hand, nowadays many Japanese eat KFC&rsquo;s chicken.

beginning We tend to overlook cases that did not come with a successful outcome. And when we do look at failure, we are often quick to explain why things failed.
Bad Decisions and Good Decisions Failure is not always explained by bad decision making. “Good decisions can lead to bad outcomes and vice versa.”
Mental Models: Focus On The Process, Not The Outcome By simply focusing on the thinking process, we can always say we did the right thing.

      Review 10/12 lesson What I wanted to say but I couldn&rsquo;t say Talk about your favorite restaurant My favorite restaurant is a pub that a brewery manages in my city. You can drink several types of sake and beer that the brewery made. I like sake especially &ldquo;Junmai Ginjo&rdquo; because it smells good and tasty. &ldquo;Junmai Ginjo&rdquo; means that the sake is made of rice, malted rice and water. In addition, the rice is polished to remove its surface, as a result it has fruity flavor and soft texture.
