      <description>I went to Sapporo last weekend. It was the first time to visit Sapporo for me. I enjoyed a snowy landscape, Snow festival, and food and drink, of course. It was an amazing trip totally.
When I arrived at Chitose airport, it was not much cold. I felt it was the same temperature as Kanagawa. Actually It was negative two degrees in Sapporo and positive two degrees in Kanagawa. It was just a little bit difference.</description>
