      <description>I had trouble falling asleep last night. Because It was hot and humid night.
I heard that the function of the brain is blunted like drunken if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough sleep.
That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t concentrate.
In these day, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of buying a bigger bed that is comfortable to sleep.</description>
