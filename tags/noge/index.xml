      <description>Today, I went out for drinking with my wife and friends in Noge, Yokohama. It was drizzling rain, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad it didn&amp;rsquo;t rain heavily.
We went to three Izakaya bars. In Noge, there are many Izakaya bars, so people go to some Izakaya bars to enjoy various dishes and drinks.
One of our friends traveled to Spain for a week in early June. She gave us some presents. We were very happy.</description>
