      <description>I use a textbook &amp;ldquo;TOUCHSTONE 2nd edition Student&amp;rsquo;s Book Level 3&amp;rdquo; in my English lesson. It&amp;rsquo;s at the low intermediate CFER level (A2-B1).
The followings are the homework I have to do by tomorrow.
page.5: Lesson-B 3.C Who do you admire ? I admire my brother.
Why ? Because, he works as a engineer in America. I also want to work as a engineer in America or Europe. I envy him working abroad and I&amp;rsquo;m proud of him.</description>

      <description>I took an English conversation lesson, it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I came back from my honeymoon.
I have visited England, Scotland, Canada and America in my honeymoon, so I thought that my English skill improve a little bit maybe, but it&amp;rsquo;s not at all.
I will study English harder than before so I can work abroad. Of course, I want to enjoy studying English. The proverb says, &amp;ldquo;what one likes, one will do well.</description>
