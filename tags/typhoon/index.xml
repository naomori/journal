      <description>I worked from home today. I had written documents for my software about its architecture, usage, how to build and installation.
The reason what I worked from home today was that the typhoon was supposed to come. But it went to somewhere. There were no winds, no heavy rain and no lightning.
The weather was so fine and hot today. It&amp;rsquo;s a season that requires air conditioning.
I will go surfing tomorrow.</description>
