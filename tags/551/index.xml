      <description>Today, I went to Osaka to get a lecture of AI.
I always buy the following this.
It&amp;rsquo;s the most famous steamed bun with meat filling in Japan, especially in Kansai region. I stayed in the line for about twenty minutes to buy it.
And then, I ate the following this because I had enough time before the departure of the Shinkansen.
It&amp;rsquo;s also famous ramen in Kansai region. The last time I ate it was when I was a graduate student, about 15 years ago.</description>
