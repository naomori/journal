      <description>Today, I spent a depraved day. I watched anime all day long. It was One punch man.
This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.</description>
