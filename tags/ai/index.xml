      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying a development environment for AI(ML/DL). I haven&amp;rsquo;t studied AI itself yet. Despite that, there are too many things I don&amp;rsquo;t know and I have a lot to learn.
It feels so good to know what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. There are many such moments since I started studying AI.
It feels so good to try new things at any age.</description>

      <description>It held a first meeting of my new task, deep learning for Embedded device. As a first milestone, I&amp;rsquo;m going to build a deep learning development environment on NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s Jetson TX2 development kit.
And I&amp;rsquo;m going to participate in Deep Learning training. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to try new technique. But it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to learn new technique. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best.</description>

      <description>Today, my boss make a proposal me about my new job. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in it. It&amp;rsquo;s about embedded AI. There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk about AI in every industry these days. If I do the work, it will improve my technical ability and lead to the next new and interesting work. The person in charge will explain the detail of the proposal to me next week. Whatever the content, I will accept this proposal.</description>
