      <description>Today, we went to Buckingham Palace to see changing of the guard. I&#39;ve seen that before on TV. There was crowded so much. A lot of tourists came to see that like us. We saw changing the guard, they were like toy soldiers. After that, we went to British Museum to see Rosetta Stone. I was very impressed because it was the key to solving the mysteries of ancient Egypt. </description>
