      <description>Today is sunny weather during the rainy season. The air temperature is high and humidity is also high, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s better than a rainy day.
Apart from that, Zozomat was announced. It measures your foot shape three-dimensionally in millimeters.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great innovation because I have had several mistakes in selecting shoes. It will be delivered this winter, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it.</description>
