      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s English lesson, I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event. I tried that, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do well at all. I think, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time. I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English. So, I can&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly in English about a theme which I&amp;rsquo;ve never think about. I&amp;rsquo;ve read books about how to study English before.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&amp;rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&amp;rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.</description>
