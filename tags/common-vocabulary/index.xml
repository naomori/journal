      <description>At the last lesson, I answered a question whose the person couldn&amp;rsquo;t have time to listen to recordings of his lectures. My advice was taking notes of his lectures, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take time rather than listening to the recordings.
And I learned the meanings of &amp;ldquo;on the good side&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;undecided&amp;rdquo;. And &amp;ldquo;make a difference&amp;rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &amp;ldquo;make a &amp;lsquo;some adjective&amp;rsquo; impression&amp;rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.</description>

      <description>I welcomed the New Year while watching a comedy TV program. I feel that it&amp;rsquo;s very happy to greet the New Year while laughing.
Unfortunately, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the sunrise and Mt.Fuji on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day because of thick cloud. Today we ate Zouni as brunch. My wife cooked Hakata Zouni which is localized in Hakata region. It contains Mochi, Katsuona(a kind of leaf mustard), Buri(a yellowtail fish), and etc. It&amp;rsquo;s really tasty, I like it.</description>

      <description>I built a raspberry pi cluster. It consists of four raspberry pi which is a micro computer. I want to learn kubernetes and docker. They are used for management of server application and its resource. You can manage the server applications and server itself using them.
I started to work with a new team that was developing applications of IoT and Cloud. If I can use and manage kubernetes and docker smoothly, I think if I can make a contribute to the team, I can transfer to the team.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s lesson was the final English lesson this year. I started to study English conversation lesson this March, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel improving my English skill so much.
I think that I ought to study English everyday. Everyday. Christmas and New year&amp;rsquo;s days are no exception. If I really want to learn English conversation and work abroad or at a japan branch of foreign distribution company, I must study English everyday.</description>

      <description>Today I went to another ophthalmic clinic.
Two weeks ago, I went to a ophthalmic clinic, because I see a small circle for an instant in my right eye when I blink. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of shadow that I see after I see a bright small light. I was worried about my eyes, however, the doctor couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the reason. The doctor said, &amp;ldquo;There is no problem now, come again a month later&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Last Saturday, I went to a dental clinic, not for cleaning. It&amp;rsquo;s for making mouthpiece. I sometimes grind my teeth while sleeping. It&amp;rsquo;s for preventing from that. Cathy said that in Philippines we slap the person who grinds teeth in a sleep. Oh, my gosh. I won&amp;rsquo;t tell that to my wife.
And I went to a ophthalmic clinic for the first time. I have never been to a ophthalmic clinic, because I have good eyes.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s English lesson, I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event. I tried that, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do well at all. I think, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time. I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English. So, I can&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly in English about a theme which I&amp;rsquo;ve never think about. I&amp;rsquo;ve read books about how to study English before.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&amp;rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&amp;rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.</description>
