      <description>D. Read the Help note. Then read the question and answer with as long as, provided that, or unless. Question I&#39;m trying to be more organized, so I decided to record my lectures, but I never have time to watch them. Any ideas?
Answer You can&#39;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&#39;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.</description>

      <description>1.C. Deliver your experience and ask your partner about her experience using the phrases. 1. &amp;ldquo;play a trick on&amp;rdquo; original question: Have you played a trick on someone? How did it turn out?
I don&#39;t remember the last time when I played a trick on someone. Well, when I was a child, I and my friends were going back home from elementary school.
I caught a small frog and put it on the shoulder of my friend without being noticed.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s homework. At the last lesson, I couldn&#39;t talk smoothly about the community event. So that It&#39;s my homework.
Who&#39;s going to do what? 1. When is the event going to be? Where? What time? We&#39;d better hold the event during summer vacation. Because adults can take day-off easily.
We might want to hold the event from 5pm to 8pm. Because children had better sleep early, not staying up late at night.</description>
