      <description>Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.C: She&#39;s just a bit odd. 1. Conversation strategy: Softening comments A. What are your neighbors like? Do you get along with them? Tell the class. My neighbors next door are a man and his daughter. It seems to me that they get along well, because I sometimes see they&#39;re talking with smile. But late at night once or twice, I heard him to shout like being drunk, so I&#39;m bit worried about it.</description>

      <description>Before starting Lesson C. I will do homework about Lesson B.
Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B, Section.2 A.7-9 7. First dates usually turn out to be a disaster! I agree with that partially. Not usually, sometimes it turns out to be a disaster. Because someone who don&#39;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&#39;t know what the another person like and don&#39;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&#39;t like.</description>

      <description>Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B: Dating 1. Building vocabulary and grammar A. High school sweethearts I have some questions about vocabularies.
&amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;work out&amp;rdquo; emphasizes this expression? If this statement doesn&#39;t use &amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo;, does it have the same meanings?
What does &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; mean? I think that there is an inconsistency between &amp;ldquo;they are now living&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo;. Because &amp;ldquo;they are now living&amp;rdquo; means the current and &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; means the future.</description>

      <description>D. Read the Help note. Then read the question and answer with as long as, provided that, or unless. Question I&#39;m trying to be more organized, so I decided to record my lectures, but I never have time to watch them. Any ideas?
Answer You can&#39;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&#39;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s homework. At the last lesson, I couldn&#39;t talk smoothly about the community event. So that It&#39;s my homework.
Who&#39;s going to do what? 1. When is the event going to be? Where? What time? We&#39;d better hold the event during summer vacation. Because adults can take day-off easily.
We might want to hold the event from 5pm to 8pm. Because children had better sleep early, not staying up late at night.</description>
