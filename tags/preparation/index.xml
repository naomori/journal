      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s homework. At the last lesson, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk smoothly about the community event. So that It&amp;rsquo;s my homework.
Who&amp;rsquo;s going to do what? 1. When is the event going to be? Where? What time? We&amp;rsquo;d better hold the event during summer vacation. Because adults can take day-off easily.
We might want to hold the event from 5pm to 8pm. Because children had better sleep early, not staying up late at night.</description>
