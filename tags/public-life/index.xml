      <description>I had a meeting about my new task yesterday. We talked about my wish, my skills and a new task of a Cloud Development team. We decided that I join the Cloud Development team temporary. For a while, I&amp;rsquo;ll work at the team and we&amp;rsquo;ll decide that I join the team officially.
I felt that the boss of the team is nice guy and the team members too, it&amp;rsquo;s a good team.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&amp;rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&amp;rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.</description>
