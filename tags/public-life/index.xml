      <description>Today, I worked for the Cloud development team for the first time. The task what I did was connecting PlayStation 4 controller with Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and confirm the buttons which you pressed on the controller. It was so easy, but I was pleased with helping them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got to make up my mind what I should do in the Cloud development team. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about building the development and operating environment of Machine-Learning with AWS and Jetson Nano.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s homework. At the last lesson, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk smoothly about the community event. So that It&amp;rsquo;s my homework.
Who&amp;rsquo;s going to do what? 1. When is the event going to be? Where? What time? We&amp;rsquo;d better hold the event during summer vacation. Because adults can take day-off easily.
We might want to hold the event from 5pm to 8pm. Because children had better sleep early, not staying up late at night.</description>

      <description>I had a meeting about my new task yesterday. We talked about my wish, my skills and a new task of a Cloud Development team. We decided that I join the Cloud Development team temporary. For a while, I&amp;rsquo;ll work at the team and we&amp;rsquo;ll decide that I join the team officially.
I felt that the boss of the team is nice guy and the team members too, it&amp;rsquo;s a good team.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&amp;rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&amp;rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.</description>
