      <description>I&#39;ve been studying a development environment for AI(ML/DL). I haven&#39;t studied AI itself yet. Despite that, there are too many things I don&#39;t know and I have a lot to learn.
It feels so good to know what I didn&#39;t know. There are many such moments since I started studying AI.
It feels so good to try new things at any age.</description>

      <description>It held a first meeting of my new task, deep learning for Embedded device. As a first milestone, I&#39;m going to build a deep learning development environment on NVIDIA&#39;s Jetson TX2 development kit.
And I&#39;m going to participate in Deep Learning training. It&#39;s interesting to try new technique. But it&#39;s not easy to learn new technique. I&#39;ll do my best.</description>
