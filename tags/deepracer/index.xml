      <description>I attended AWS Summit Tokyo 2019 today. It will be held in 3 days. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna attend it every days.
Keynote (10:00-11:30) The music was loud at the venue and it was like rock concert, so I was a little excited. The opening of keynote was started with movies and dance. It&amp;rsquo;s completely concert.
In this AWS Summit Tokyo 2019, 33,000+ have been registered. AWS has 50% share in cloud business, it&amp;rsquo;s great.</description>
