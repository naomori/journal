      <description>I, my wife and our friends went to the Gyoza restaurant in Kameari, Tokyo. The restaurant are introduced many times in TV shows, and very famous in Chiba. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go there since two years ago and at last I went there today.
The gyoza restaurant is named &amp;ldquo;White gyoza&amp;rdquo;. This is because Mr.Paku started the restaurant, his name means &amp;ldquo;White&amp;rdquo; in Japanese.
The gyoza dumpling is famous for their cooking methods.</description>
