      <description>a book you&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to read? Even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t read a book in these days, I started to read a book yesterday. Because the book I reserved a half year ago in a city library was arrived. The title is &amp;ldquo;Mastering Civility&amp;rdquo;. Although I just started reading the book, it will help me in life, I think. Because I always have one rude friend or colleague, so I want to deal with it well.</description>

      <description>When I meet my friends for a long time, I catch up with them. I talk about my recent state, work, hobby, where interesting place I went recently, what something special I did, and so on.
About four months ago, my friend contacted me via facebook messenger. He is a friend when we were in a graduate school. He said &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you have a reunion with our laboratory&amp;rsquo;s member?&amp;rdquo;. I agreed with that and I asked him to invite other members.</description>

      <description>The peak of technology I think that the peak of technology is cyber-brain and full-body prosthesis. A cyber-brain allows people to interface their biological brain with various networks. A fully prosthetic body makes a person become a cyborg.
A cyber-brain can improve the Human-Machine interface amazingly, it can allow people to access machines and data super easily like thinking. The current human-Machine interface devices, like a keyboard, a mouse, a touch pad and screen, or voice commands, are really not kind to people.</description>

      <description>I have my homework about role-play phone conversations. My teacher, Cathy said that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to practice phone conversations by next lesson. At the next lesson, we&amp;rsquo;ve got to have some role-play phone conversations, so that I have to think about some situations.
And, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to use phrases below.
 I&amp;rsquo;d better go. I&amp;rsquo;ve got to get going. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to run. Can I call you back? I&amp;rsquo;ll call you later.</description>
