      <description>I have my homework about role-play phone conversations. My teacher, Cathy said that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to practice phone conversations by next lesson. At the next lesson, we&amp;rsquo;ve got to have some role-play phone conversations, so that I have to think about some situations.
And, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to use phrases below. * I&amp;rsquo;d better go. * I&amp;rsquo;ve got to get going. * I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to run. * Can I call you back?</description>
