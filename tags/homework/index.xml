      <description>The peak of technology I think that the peak of technology is cyber-brain and full-body prosthesis. A cyber-brain allows people to interface their biological brain with various networks. A fully prosthetic body makes a person become a cyborg.
A cyber-brain can improve the Human-Machine interface amazingly, it can allow people to access machines and data super easily like thinking. The current human-Machine interface devices, like a keyboard, a mouse, a touch pad and screen, or voice commands, are really not kind to people.</description>

      <description>I have my homework about role-play phone conversations. My teacher, Cathy said that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to practice phone conversations by next lesson. At the next lesson, we&amp;rsquo;ve got to have some role-play phone conversations, so that I have to think about some situations.
And, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to use phrases below.
 I&amp;rsquo;d better go. I&amp;rsquo;ve got to get going. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to run. Can I call you back? I&amp;rsquo;ll call you later.</description>
