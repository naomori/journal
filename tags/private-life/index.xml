      <description>At yesterday&#39;s lesson, I learned to build sentences using common collocations with do, make, and etc. In addition, I reviewed unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively. I used too many times &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; as conjunctions, though. I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.
At last I&#39;ll be transferred to new department. I&#39;m gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don&#39;t have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.</description>

      <description>Today is my wife&#39;s birthday. I presented fluffy pajamas, champagne and a champagne glass to her. She was very pleased and I was glad to see that. The fluffy pajamas was Gelato pique&#39;s one that she&#39;s been wanted before. Champagne was Veuve Clicquot that is the one of her favorite. And the champagne glass was Riedel&#39;s one. Riedel&#39;s glass makes a difference in taste of wine.
Even if you aren&#39;t a wine expert, you can feel the difference between normal glass and Riedel&#39;s one.</description>

      <description>D. Read the Help note. Then read the question and answer with as long as, provided that, or unless. Question I&#39;m trying to be more organized, so I decided to record my lectures, but I never have time to watch them. Any ideas?
Answer You can&#39;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&#39;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.</description>

      <description>I welcomed the New Year while watching a comedy TV program. I feel that it&#39;s very happy to greet the New Year while laughing.
Unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t see the sunrise and Mt.Fuji on New Year&#39;s Day because of thick cloud. Today we ate Zouni as brunch. My wife cooked Hakata Zouni which is localized in Hakata region. It contains Mochi, Katsuona(a kind of leaf mustard), Buri(a yellowtail fish), and etc. It&#39;s really tasty, I like it.</description>

      <description>Today I and my wife ate Toshikoshi-soba for lunch. My wife cooked it for us. Eating toshikoshi-soba is the traditional custom in Japan. We Japanese wish healthful long life and eat it on new year&#39;s eve. The long soba noodles symbolize a long life. The buckwheat plant can survive severe weather during growing period, so that soba represents strength and resiliency.
After lunch, I went surfing. There were fine waves and I enjoyed.</description>

      <description>I received Christmas presents from my brother who lives in Michigan, America. I love American foods, spices and snacks.
I went to America on my way of honeymoon. I wanted to introduce my wife to my brother&#39;s family. And I&#39;d like to eat American and Canadian foods, and see the Niagara falls again.
I&#39;ve been there with my dad and mom three years ago. It was an amazing experience, but it was not enough to visit there only once.</description>

      <description>I was relaxed today totally. I watched some TV shows, that were recorded before, late last night. And I woke up about eleven o&#39;clock. I and my wife had a lunch and went shopping to buy some food and drink for new year&#39;s eve and new year&#39;s days.
And I went surfing. There were comfortable waves and I could enjoy surfing.
That&#39;s it. I wish I could have a day like today every day.</description>

      <description>1.C. Deliver your experience and ask your partner about her experience using the phrases. 1. &amp;ldquo;play a trick on&amp;rdquo; original question: Have you played a trick on someone? How did it turn out?
I don&#39;t remember the last time when I played a trick on someone. Well, when I was a child, I and my friends were going back home from elementary school.
I caught a small frog and put it on the shoulder of my friend without being noticed.</description>

      <description>Touchstone-3 Unit-6: Managing life Lesson D: Less is more 1. Reading A. Do you ever multitask? What kinds of things do you do at the same time? Is multitasking a good thing to do? About 20 years ago, when I was at network operation team in the previous company, I sometimes did multitask.
When I was in a network trouble, I&#39;ve done multitask. It was calling customer, solving the problems, writing the report, asking my colleague to help me by a chat tool, and explaining that to my boss at the same time.</description>

So, I had to get ready to go out in 20 minutes.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&#39;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&#39;ve got to learn those.
And I&#39;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&#39;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.</description>
