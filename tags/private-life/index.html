      At last lesson, my teacher Cathy said that I have to research about Zen and I have to tell her what is Zen and how to do Zen. It&rsquo;s difficult to explain about Zen, I think. Because Zen is one of religions, so it must be complicated and confusing. At first, I searched Zen by Google.
Zen is one of training of Zenshu. Zenshu is one sect of Buddhism, and the goal of Zenshu is to attain spiritual enlightenment.

Some people says it&rsquo;s too much to worry about. Yeah, I know. But, my wife is weak, so it will be a problem if she is infected with corona virus. Because corona virus kills people who have a health problem.
I wish that corona virus doesn&rsquo;t spread any more.

      I went to Sapporo last weekend. It was the first time to visit Sapporo for me. I enjoyed a snowy landscape, Snow festival, and food and drink, of course. It was an amazing trip totally.
When I arrived at Chitose airport, it was not much cold. I felt it was the same temperature as Kanagawa. It was negative two degrees in Sapporo and positive two degrees in Kanagawa, actually. It was just a little bit difference.

Because someone who don&rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&rsquo;t like.

      This weekend was relaxing days. I went to the city library and borrowed a book, the title is &ldquo;Talking to My Daughter About the Economy.&quot;. I didn&rsquo;t read it yet.
After that I went to shopping at near super market and bought lots of food and drink. Because I had a trip to Aomori two weekends ago, so that I couldn&rsquo;t go to shopping.
In addition, I run at the seaside for about 1 hour, 10 kilo meters.

      I and my wife enjoyed a 3-days trip in Aomori last weekend. We traveled by train. I have never taken the Tohoku shinkansen until this time. I was looking forward to a train lunch box in the Tohoku shinkansen. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t sold in the train. I don&rsquo;t why it wasn&rsquo;t, however, I was disappointed with that. Probably, Tokyo lunch box isn&rsquo;t popular very much.
Day 1, after four and half hours train, we arrived in Aomori at 1:00 pm.

      At yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned to build sentences using common collocations with do, make, and etc. In addition, I reviewed unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively. I used too many times &ldquo;and&rdquo; as conjunctions, though. I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.
At last I&rsquo;ll be transferred to new department. I&rsquo;m gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don&rsquo;t have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.

      Today is my wife&rsquo;s birthday. I presented fluffy pajamas, champagne and a champagne glass to her. She was very pleased and I was glad to see that. The fluffy pajamas was Gelato pique&rsquo;s one that she&rsquo;s been wanted before. Champagne was Veuve Clicquot that is the one of her favorite. And the champagne glass was Riedel&rsquo;s one. Riedel&rsquo;s glass makes a difference in taste of wine.
Even if you aren&rsquo;t a wine expert, you can feel the difference between normal glass and Riedel&rsquo;s one.

Answer You can&rsquo;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&rsquo;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.

My wife cooked Hakata Zouni which is localized in Hakata region. It contains Mochi, Katsuona(a kind of leaf mustard), Buri(a yellowtail fish), and etc. It&rsquo;s really tasty, I like it.

The buckwheat plant can survive severe weather during growing period, so that soba represents strength and resiliency.
After lunch, I went surfing. There were fine waves and I enjoyed.

At first I&rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.
