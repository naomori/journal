Last weekend, I went to surfing and I enjoyed it. Because typhoon swell arrived at the beach and there are many good waves to surf. However, typhoon has gone, also waves have gone. It left just strong wind. Strong wind is bad for surfin. Because it disturbs waves, the sea surface is bumpy and it doesn&rsquo;t fit for surfing.

      I hurt my right wrist last week. It&rsquo;s because of too much typing keyboard and mouse click, I guess. So, I went to a doctor to have my right wrist seen. I had my arm taken a x-ray picture then. The doctor said that one of my arm bone is little longer than ordinary. That is, when I move my wrist right and left, the bone tend to push the cartilage.

      Today is the 75th anniversary of end of World War II.
Not to start wars, we need to have reasons and intelligence. Education grow them up. We need to learn history, however there is no right history. There is just lots of aspects about history. That is, they&rsquo;re different on each country or each person. We need to learn various history not to start wars.

      Today, I had my air conditioner replaced. I didn&rsquo;t think about that, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been supposed that I had my air conditioner fixed, not replaced.

Anyway, I appreciated it. New air conditioner is clean and powerful. It cools down my room quickly than before.

      Yesterday, I cooked Takoyaki again. I actually failed to cook Takoyaki a week ago, however I failed it. Because I mixed mashed yamaimo yam with Takoyaki dough, so that the dough was sticky.

I didn&rsquo;t mix mashed Yamaimo yam with Takoyaki dough this time, because I have learned it.

      At last, I decided to build my desktop computer. The latest desktop computer has fast and multicore CPU, huge and fast storage, a liquid cooler and GPU. It&rsquo;s super expensive, about 400,000-500,000 yen. On the other hand, when you build them yourself, it&rsquo;s cheeper to build them than buy it. So, I&rsquo;m decided to build them. Because I&rsquo;m unsatisfied with the performance of my laptop. Since I work from home, I&rsquo;ve been using my laptop for handling with huge data, such as images.

      This week, I was trying to train a model which recognize human faces and vehicle registration plates. However, I have a problem that the it needs more CPU power to train a model. It&rsquo;s a practical problem. So I decided to use Google Colaboratory to use more CPU and GPU/TPU to compute faster. Although, I have another problem about a storage to hold a dataset for training the model. The problem is that Google Colaboratory can&rsquo;t have much storage, therefore I want to use Amazon S3 and tried it, but it&rsquo;s too slow to read.

      Last weekend, I tried my new surfboard. In short, it&rsquo;s an amazing surfboard. I could take off earlier than my shorter surfboard as well as more enjoyable. Because I could get more pushing power from waves and also feel like wave is softer than before. Maybe the surfboard is bigger and heavier than my other surfboard. On the other hand, I little worried about that it&rsquo;s little bit more difficult to ride surfboard with single fin.

      I worked from home today, as usual. I went to surfing yesterday and the day before yesterday. I tried bodyboard at that time. This week, there was strong wind and high waves. so that it&rsquo;s tough to surf using middle length surfboard, I thought. So, I used a bodyboard and wore swim fins. Because it&rsquo;s easier to move by kicking with swim fins than hand paddle. When there is high waves, I have to dive under waves but it&rsquo;s tough to use middle length board.

      English school where I have classes lifted restrictions of having online class. However, I&rsquo;ll keep having English lesson online. Because I don&rsquo;t want to ride crowded train and I&rsquo;m little worry about having a class in a small booth.
Today I had online seminars about Amazon Web Services. It was interesting. Moreover, not only Amazon but also tech companies are going to hold various online seminars next month. I&rsquo;m looking forward to those online classes.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Just like yesterday, I went to surfing after work. It was windy, so surface of the sea was bumpy and it was little difficult to ride waves.
In these days, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying knee-riding, which is way to ride on my knees on a surfboard. It&rsquo;s easy to ride waves and I can enjoy to feel more waves. However, it isn&rsquo;t a commonly way to ride waves. I know that.

      I went to surfing this afternoon and evening. I enjoyed surfing from 5:30pm until little after 7:00pm. The days are getting longer in these days, so I can enjoy surfing a lot than before. It&rsquo;s very good surfing after work. I feel tiring from work has gone. Actually I&rsquo;m exhausted after surfing, though.
Anyway, since I started to work from home, I have time to free than before. So, I can enjoy everyday without stress from commuting.

It was good saves to surf in the morning rather than around sunset, however, there was few surfers rather than morning, so that I could enjoy surfing much.

      At the last lesson, I learned about separable phrasal verbs, and practiced linking consonants and vowels.
I had a English lesson via video call for the first time. At first, I&rsquo;ve got bewildered in unfamiliar remote lesson. However, several minutes later I got used to getting a remote lesson.
It&rsquo;s sometimes noisy and unclear at a remote lesson, but it&rsquo;s a good experience for a phone interview to change my job, I think.

I found that I can&rsquo;t listen to link words as liaison. It seems to me that it&rsquo;s a new word that I haven&rsquo;t heard of. So, next lesson I&rsquo;m gonna learn about link words.

Furthermore, I learned about &lsquo;neat&rsquo; and &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;. You can use &ldquo;that would be neat&rdquo;, when you listen to someone who talked you about reasonable and simple idea to solve a problem. And you can use &ldquo;why not?

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about dilemmas and some verbs + prepositions.

I answered questions which have dilemmas.
And today, I worked from home all day. It&rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.

      Yesterday&rsquo;s I worked from home. I hate commuting, so I was able to be relaxed and work. I did some tutorials to make AWS Greengrass on Raspberry Pi connect to AWS. I had some troubles, but I made it.
I had wrist-ache. I don&rsquo;t the reason, but I have been typed a keyboard too much, I think. It&rsquo;s painful even if I do nothing. I hope that it&rsquo;s cured soon.

What does &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo; mean? I think that there is an inconsistency between &ldquo;they are now living&rdquo; and &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo;. Because &ldquo;they are now living&rdquo; means the current and &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo; means the future.

      This weekend was relaxing days. I went to the city library and borrowed a book, the title is &ldquo;Talking to My Daughter About the Economy.&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t read it yet.
After that I went to shopping at near super market and bought lots of food and drink. Because I had a trip to Aomori two weekends ago, so that I couldn&rsquo;t go to shopping.
In addition, I run at the seaside for about 1 hour, 10 kilo meters.

      I and my wife enjoyed a 3-days trip in Aomori last weekend. We traveled by train. I have never taken the Tohoku shinkansen until this time. I was looking forward to a train lunch box in the Tohoku shinkansen. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t sold in the train. I don&rsquo;t why it wasn&rsquo;t, however, I was disappointed with that. Probably, Tokyo lunch box isn&rsquo;t popular very much.
Day 1, after four and half hours train, we arrived in Aomori at 1:00 pm.

The fluffy pajamas was Gelato pique&rsquo;s one that she&rsquo;s been wanted before. Champagne was Veuve Clicquot that is the one of her favorite. And the champagne glass was Riedel&rsquo;s one. Riedel&rsquo;s glass makes a difference in taste of wine.
Even if you aren&rsquo;t a wine expert, you can feel the difference between normal glass and Riedel&rsquo;s one.

Answer You can&rsquo;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&rsquo;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.
