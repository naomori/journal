      <description>Today, I surfed in this morning and this evening. The waves size are from shoulder to head, it&amp;rsquo;s high for me. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to getting out to out-side.
I rode waves only a few times, and wiped out many times. The sea is fairly cold that I might caught a bit cold. Still, I enjoyed surfing very much and I will keep surfing.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It&amp;rsquo;s the Softech&amp;rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7&#39;0&amp;rdquo;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.</description>
