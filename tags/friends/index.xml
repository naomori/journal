      <description>Today I watched Friends after a long time, because I thought that I could learn daily conversation by wathing this movie.
In NETFLIX, I can download its movies, so I can watch them during commuting.
To learn daily conversation, I will watch it twice each time. The first time, I watch it in Japanese with English caption to know what each its quotes mean. The second time, I watch it in English with English caption, so I learn pronunciation and expressions in English.</description>
