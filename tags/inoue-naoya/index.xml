      <description>Tonight, the most interesting boxing fight will be held in Japan. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Monster versus The Filipino Flash&amp;rdquo;.
Donaire was the strongest boxer in bantamweight until Inoue&amp;rsquo;s come. There was no boxer to worth to fight with Donaire in bantamweight, so he gained his weight to featherweight to fight with stronger boxers. But, it was too heavy for him in featherweight. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring his true strength.
At last, Donaire fights with Inoue tonight.</description>
