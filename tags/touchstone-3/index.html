Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B, Section.2 A.7-9 7. First dates usually turn out to be a disaster! I agree with that partially. Not usually, sometimes it turns out to be a disaster. Because someone who don&rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&rsquo;t like.

Answer You can&rsquo;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&rsquo;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.
