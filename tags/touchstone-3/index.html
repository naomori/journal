All you have to do are to plug it in, hook it up with your wireless network, and to register your amazon account into it. If you register your google calendar into it, you can see your schedule on Alexa which has a display, or you can know your schedule when you ask Alexa.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about dilemmas and some verbs + prepositions. Dilemma means a situation in which it&rsquo;s very difficult to decide what to do, because all the choices seem equally good or equally bad. Longman dictionary says that. I answered questions which have dilemmas.
And today, I worked from home all day. It&rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.

Furthermore, I started lesson B about dilemmas. I made some sentences which have dilemmas, however I couldn&rsquo;t do well. I usually don&rsquo;t feel dilemmas, I live simply every day, I guess.
Anyway, at the next lesson, I&rsquo;m gonna continue to learn about dilemmas. My homework is to make some sentences about my dilemmas.

      Before starting Lesson C. I will do homework about Lesson B.
Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B, Section.2 A.7-9 7. First dates usually turn out to be a disaster! I agree with that partially. Not usually, sometimes it turns out to be a disaster. Because someone who don&rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&rsquo;t like.

      Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B: Dating 1. Building vocabulary and grammar A. High school sweethearts I have some questions about vocabularies.
&ldquo;out&rdquo; of &ldquo;work out&rdquo; emphasizes this expression? If this statement doesn&rsquo;t use &ldquo;out&rdquo;, does it have the same meanings?
What does &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo; mean? I think that there is an inconsistency between &ldquo;they are now living&rdquo; and &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo;. Because &ldquo;they are now living&rdquo; means the current and &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo; means the future.

      D. Read the Help note. Then read the question and answer with as long as, provided that, or unless. Question I&rsquo;m trying to be more organized, so I decided to record my lectures, but I never have time to watch them. Any ideas?
Answer You can&rsquo;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&rsquo;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.

When I was in a network trouble, I&rsquo;ve done multitask. It was calling customer, solving the problems, writing the report, asking my colleague to help me by a chat tool, and explaining that to my boss at the same time.
