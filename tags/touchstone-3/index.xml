      <description>Before starting Lesson C. I will do homework about Lesson B.
Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B, Section.2 A.7-9 7. First dates usually turn out to be a disaster! I agree with that partially. Not usually, sometimes it turns out to be a disaster. Because someone who don&amp;rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&amp;rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&amp;rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&amp;rsquo;t like.</description>

      <description>Unit-7: Relationships Lesson.B: Dating 1. Building vocabulary and grammar A. High school sweethearts I have some questions about vocabularies.
&amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;work out&amp;rdquo; emphasizes this expression? If this statement doesn&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo;, does it have the same meanings?
What does &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; mean? I think that there is an inconsistency between &amp;ldquo;they are now living&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo;. Because &amp;ldquo;they are now living&amp;rdquo; means the current and &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; means the future.</description>
