      <description>I haven&#39;t had a good sleep these days. I don&#39;t know why, but I want to get some good sleep. I want to enjoy my work, my hobby, and my life. For those, good sleep is essential.
So, I bought Yakult 1000. Yakult say that it can help me take good sleep and it can relieve stress. I will take it for a while. Even if it doesn&#39;t work, it doesn&#39;t matter.</description>
