      <description>This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.</description>
