      <description>I and my wife went to Kurumaya in Fujisawa. Kurumaya had a special service for summer only. Yukata and japanese cuisine were included in the set, and the Kimono teacher dressed us in yukata. In addition, a professional photographer took a picture of us.
The meal was very delicious. We will definitely be there next year.</description>
