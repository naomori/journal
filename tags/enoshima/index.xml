      <description>I have been running along the Kugenuma coast. That was the first time in a month. It was very humid and hot, but it was nice to run along the seafront at night.
On the sandy beach, the construction of a sea house was being promoted at night, and I felt the arrival of summer.
The followings are my homework by next Wednesday.
