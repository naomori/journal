      <description>Today I watched Friends after a long time, because I thought that I could learn daily conversation by wathing this movie.
In NETFLIX, I can download its movies, so I can watch them during commuting.
To learn daily conversation, I will watch it twice each time. The first time, I watch it in Japanese with English caption to know what each its quotes mean. The second time, I watch it in English with English caption, so I learn pronunciation and expressions in English.</description>

      <description>I registered to NETFLIX, because it displays movie&amp;rsquo;s caption in English. To study English in a fun way, it&amp;rsquo;s good for me to watch movies in English. My favorite movie is &amp;ldquo;You vs. Wild&amp;rdquo; featuring Bear Grylls.
NETFLIX is free for the first month, so during the period I will try to find out if NETFLIX is useful to studying English.
I like movies very much, so &amp;ldquo;what one likes, one will do well.</description>
