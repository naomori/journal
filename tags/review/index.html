      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I practiced linking words and learned expressions to have someone agree with me. Moreover, I talked about technology matters, what technology bring us, good things and bad things.
I was given homework to speak about movies what I&rsquo;ve ever watched showed highest future technology. To be precise, What do you think is the peak of technology and provide similar movie about it. Do short presentation.

      At the last lesson, I practiced linking words and learned about giving different opinions using &lsquo;I know what you mean, but&rsquo;, &lsquo;Maybe. On the other hand, &lsquo;,&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Don&rsquo;t you think&rsquo;, and so on.
I worked from home today, but I went to the office yesterday. Because I took a GPU box back from my workplace to home. I bought it last month and it was delivered to my workplace last week.

      At the last lesson, I learned about separable phrasal verbs, and practiced linking consonants and vowels.
I had a English lesson via video call for the first time. At first, I&rsquo;ve got bewildered in unfamiliar remote lesson. However, several minutes later I got used to getting a remote lesson.
It&rsquo;s sometimes noisy and unclear at a remote lesson, but it&rsquo;s a good experience for a phone interview to change my job, I think.

      At the last lesson, I learned making questions within sentences. And I delivered my opinions about those questions. Moreover, I answered questions about the Internet.
I found that I can&rsquo;t listen to link words as liaison. It seems to me that it&rsquo;s a new word that I haven&rsquo;t heard of. So, next lesson I&rsquo;m gonna learn about link words.

      At today&rsquo;s lesson, I talked about what I would do if I had last year to live over again. I didn&rsquo;t do enough what I wanted to do last year. I would definitely do more efficiently and effectively. I wasted much time doing watch movies and my smart phone too much. Furthermore I found that I had many things I wanted to do. I sometimes should look back what I did, I thought.

      At the last lesson, I and my teacher cleared my goals of learning English in Cebu.
My goals are, firstly, to speak general English smoothly, frequently, and naturally. Because I want to enjoy small talks with people who I meet in trip. If I could do that, I could have new idea and thought to enjoy my life through their culture, history, custom, and etc.
Secondary is to get a job abroad, like the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, or New Zealand, and so on.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about dilemmas and some verbs + prepositions. Dilemma means a situation in which it&rsquo;s very difficult to decide what to do, because all the choices seem equally good or equally bad. Longman dictionary says that. I answered questions which have dilemmas.
And today, I worked from home all day. It&rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.

Anyway, at the next lesson, I&rsquo;m gonna continue to learn about dilemmas. My homework is to make some sentences about my dilemmas.

      At the last lesson, I learned to soften comments and make sentences using those phrases. And I tried to continue speaking for one minute about something theme.
I sometimes couldn&rsquo;t find my words, however, I almost could continue speaking. It was prepared theme in advance, not free theme, though. My teacher, Cathay said that I prepared every lessons in advance and it was good, but I prepared too much, though. She meant that I only studied a few situations that the book described.

      I learned softening comments using &ldquo;I think&rdquo;, &ldquo;a little bit&rdquo;, &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;, &ldquo;kind of&rdquo;, etc. In addition, I made some sentences with those expressions to soften. I mostly made it, however, I couldn&rsquo;t respond quickly, though.
I&rsquo;ll practice more and more.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I practiced to continue speaking for one minute. In addition, I practiced to use some common phrasal verbs and various conjunctions. It was difficult to build my opinion, and use phrasal verbs and various conjunctions at the same time. I couldn&rsquo;t find any words and use those phrasal verbs and conjunctions very much.
On the other hand, the phrasal verbs and various conjunctions like those are important to casual conversation.

      I learned some vocabularies and grammars about dating. And I learned some phrasal verbs like get along, go out, break up and so on.
In addition, I learned elope and burn bridge. &ldquo;Elope&rdquo; means to leave from your home to get married even though your parents don&rsquo;t allow you to do that. And &ldquo;burn bridge&rdquo; means that you can&rsquo;t get back once you&rsquo;ve done that.
I tried to speak for one minute about anything, but I couldn&rsquo;t.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I reviewed Unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. It&rsquo;s about ways to talk about the future and food. Again I tried to get off the phone, I didn&rsquo;t do well though. I couldn&rsquo;t end the conversation smoothly and naturally.
I finished Unit 4 to 6 at last, so next lesson, I&rsquo;m going to begin Unit 7 about relationships. I&rsquo;m little worried whether I can do well, because I&rsquo;m introverted.

      At yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned to build sentences using common collocations with do, make, and etc. In addition, I reviewed unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively. I used too many times &ldquo;and&rdquo; as conjunctions, though. I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.
At last I&rsquo;ll be transferred to new department. I&rsquo;m gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don&rsquo;t have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.

      At the last lesson, I answered a question whose the person couldn&rsquo;t have time to listen to recordings of his lectures. My advice was taking notes of his lectures, because it doesn&rsquo;t take time rather than listening to the recordings.
And I learned the meanings of &ldquo;on the good side&rdquo; and &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;. And &ldquo;make a difference&rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &ldquo;make a &lsquo;some adjective&rsquo; impression&rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I practiced delivering my experience and making a question. I couldn&rsquo;t respond quickly, and I took time to deliver my experience. It was difficult to organize thoughts first before delivering. I felt I had to respond quickly, on the contrary I couldn&rsquo;t find my words. Or I found only meaning less words.

At the previous lesson, I couldn&rsquo;t keep discussing about a community event. This time I did. I was relieved to be able to do that. I was a bit nervous before the last lesson. But I did and I got a bit confidence about English conversation.

      Today&rsquo;s English lesson, I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event. I tried that, however, I couldn&rsquo;t do well at all. I think, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time. I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English. So, I can&rsquo;t respond quickly in English about a theme which I&rsquo;ve never think about. I&rsquo;ve read books about how to study English before.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson.
I learned about the difference between assertive and aggressive. Assertive means that you are confident and say clearly what you think or what you want without attacking someone. It&rsquo;s polite and positive. Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly, but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.
And, I learned about phone conversation. When you call someone, first, you&rsquo;ve got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc. Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.

I learned the following vocabularies.
 philanthropist  I told my teacher about my uncle who is keen on volunteering and then my teacher called him a philanthropist.   divorce and annulment  I didn&rsquo;t know the word annulment, and so I can&rsquo;t understand the difference between divorce and annulment.
