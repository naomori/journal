      <description>In yesterday English lesson, I had my teacher check my blog again and reviewed Unit-4, and then finished it. And I started to learn Unit-5 and found that my teacher eats crisps too much.
I learned the following vocabularies.
 philanthropist  I told my teacher about my uncle who is keen on volunteering and then my teacher called him a philanthropist.  divorce and annulment  I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the word annulment, and so I can&amp;rsquo;t understand the difference between divorce and annulment.</description>
