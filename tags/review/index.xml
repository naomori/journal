      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk well in English at the today&amp;rsquo;s lesson. I can&amp;rsquo;t find my words and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;ldquo;let me see,&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and so on during thinking. While I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about what I should say or what I want to say, I ought to say something to connect between conversation. I have no idea about that.
So, I read this below.
 EIGLOBE English  Basic  Well &amp;hellip; So &amp;hellip; You know &amp;hellip; I mean &amp;hellip;  while thinking about answer  Let me see &amp;hellip; Let&amp;rsquo;s see &amp;hellip; Good question.</description>

      <description>At yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer the two questions below.
 Why did Japanese government decide to lift emergency declaration for corona virus? Why do I think Japanese prime minister Abe might be failed next election?  I&amp;rsquo;m gonna answer the questions above here.
1. Why did Japanese government decide to lift emergency declaration for corona virus? Japanese government might keep lifting emergency declaration unless hospital beds run out. We all know that pandemic can&amp;rsquo;t be calm down soon and it must be keeping out-break until at least two years later, because we don&amp;rsquo;t have any vaccine and medicine for corona virus now, and we might not have it until next year in the shortest.</description>

      <description>I had English class just now. Today&amp;rsquo;s class was earlier than usual. As lockdowns eases, students of English school is coming back. So, I can&amp;rsquo;t reserve as I want recently.
I learned grammar of modal verbs for speculating on today&amp;rsquo;s class. And I speculated looking at the several pictures. I&amp;rsquo;ve finished Lesson A of Unit 11.
My teacher told me that I ought not to say &amp;lsquo;Ummm&amp;hellip; Hmmm&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; when I&amp;rsquo;m wondering what I say.</description>

I have a homework. I have to write a review about concert, a show, a movie, or a book I&amp;rsquo;ve seen or read.
Actually, in today&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I talked just about surfing, news and movies. So, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go forward on textbook well.</description>

      <description>I watched a film, &amp;ldquo;Annihilation&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a science fiction horror film. It was released theatricaly in 2018, but it became a box office bomb. And then it was released digitally by Netflix. You can watch it now on Netflix.

      <description>I studied about favors at work. I summarized conversations between people and their boss. And I practiced role play, a person and his boss or colleagues.
However, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t summarize conversations well.

In addition, she mentioned PREP, PREP means Point, Reason, Example/Explanation, Point.

      <description>I went to surfing this afternoon and evening. I enjoyed surfing from 5:30pm until little after 7:00pm. The days are getting longer in these days, so I can enjoy surfing a lot than before. It&amp;rsquo;s very good surfing after work. I feel tiring from work has gone. Actually I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted after surfing, though.
Anyway, since I started to work from home, I have time to free than before. So, I can enjoy everyday without stress from commuting.</description>

      <description>At yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about how to use &amp;lsquo;already&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;still&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;yet&amp;rsquo; with present perfect. At beginning of the lesson, I talked about the article which I&amp;rsquo;ve read, however I couldn&amp;rsquo;t explain it well. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t summarize it well and couldn&amp;rsquo;t deliver my opinion clearly and smoothly. Because I didn&amp;rsquo;t organize my opinion about it. I&amp;rsquo;ve read news carefully with looking up words I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, so far. But it&amp;rsquo;s not good to understand articles and practice conversation, I guess.</description>

Someone actor is in it. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of violent or some thing ajective, though.   It&amp;rsquo;s take plain in somewhere. Someone actor plays something role who does something.</description>

Recently, my teacher haven&amp;rsquo;t given structured lessons, just talking. So, I have to do something that makes lessons effective. First, I&amp;rsquo;ll bring up some subjects to make small talk at the beginning of the lesson.</description>

      <description>I spent lazy time today just like I did yesterday. I woke up late, ate lunch, took a nap and studied little bit English. It&amp;rsquo;s too bad. To change my job, I should improve English and technical skill. I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to waste. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t forget it and I always have to remember it. I have to live a regular life and keep studying during holidays. I&amp;rsquo;ll do it. I said it yesterday as well, though.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I studied vocabulary notebook about on and off. I reviewed phrasal verbs and made some sentences using phrasal verbs.
From tomorrow, my holidays are gonna start. However, unfortunately I can&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere due to corona virus. Most shops and restaurants are closed, and the local people might not welcome people who come from other places, because of suppressing infection of corona virus.
Now, very gloomy atmosphere is sweeping over Japan.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll make sentences using vocabularies I&amp;rsquo;ve learned at the last lesson, privately, publicly, scam, cheating, trick, &amp;lsquo;when it comes to&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;, and hold onto.
Outbreak of Corona virus in Japan is less terrible than other countries, the one of the reasons is that Japanese people don&amp;rsquo;t hug, shake hands, and cheek kiss privately. In addition, another reason is that Japanese people wear a mask and don&amp;rsquo;t speak much in the train, buses, and elevators publicly.</description>

      <description>Also today, I worked from home. I did some stretching exercises this morning and yesterday&amp;rsquo;s morning after waking up. Then, I can get through the day comfortably. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to do stretching after waking up.
I had an English lesson yesterday. It was a remote lesson via zoom, video call. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to have a remote lesson, I think. However I&amp;rsquo;ll have a offline lesson if I can. There is a good point on a offline lesson, that is I can see a teacher&amp;rsquo;s mouth behavior and hear clear pronunciation.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I practiced linking words and learned about giving different opinions using &amp;lsquo;I know what you mean, but&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Maybe. On the other hand, &amp;lsquo;,&amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Don&amp;rsquo;t you think&amp;rsquo;, and so on.
I worked from home today, but I went to the office yesterday. Because I took a GPU box back from my workplace to home. I bought it last month and it was delivered to my workplace last week.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I learned about separable phrasal verbs, and practiced linking consonants and vowels.
I had a English lesson via video call for the first time. At first, I&amp;rsquo;ve got bewildered in unfamiliar remote lesson. However, several minutes later I got used to getting a remote lesson.
It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes noisy and unclear at a remote lesson, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good experience for a phone interview to change my job, I think.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I learned making questions within sentences. And I delivered my opinions about those questions. Moreover, I answered questions about the Internet.
I found that I can&amp;rsquo;t listen to link words as liaison. It seems to me that it&amp;rsquo;s a new word that I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of. So, next lesson I&amp;rsquo;m gonna learn about link words.</description>

      <description>At today&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I talked about what I would do if I had last year to live over again. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do enough what I wanted to do last year. I would definitely do more efficiently and effectively. I wasted much time doing watch movies and my smart phone too much. Furthermore I found that I had many things I wanted to do. I sometimes should look back what I did, I thought.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I and my teacher cleared my goals of learning English in Cebu.
My goals are, firstly, to speak general English smoothly, frequently, and naturally. Because I want to enjoy small talks with people who I meet in trip. If I could do that, I could have new idea and thought to enjoy my life through their culture, history, custom, and etc.
Secondary is to get a job abroad, like the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, or New Zealand, and so on.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about dilemmas and some verbs + prepositions. Dilemma means a situation in which it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to decide what to do, because all the choices seem equally good or equally bad. Longman dictionary says that. I answered questions which have dilemmas.
And today, I worked from home all day. It&amp;rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.</description>

      <description>At today&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about grammar of wishes and imaginary situations or events. And I made some sentences with wishes and imaginary situations. Furthermore, I started lesson B about dilemmas. I made some sentences which have dilemmas, however I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do well. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t feel dilemmas, I live simply every day, I guess.
Anyway, at the next lesson, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna continue to learn about dilemmas. My homework is to make some sentences about my dilemmas.</description>

      <description>At yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I talked about my first Sapporo trip. My teacher has been to Sapporo, but on September. She envied me for winter Sapporo. Autumn Sapporo is also good, I think. However, amazing snowy landscape in Sapporo was amazing and fantastic.
For my homework, I gave some advice to younger people about online dating and something. Furthermore I talked about getting back in touch with my old friends, and how I met my best friends.</description>

      <description>At the last lesson, I learned to soften comments and make sentences using those phrases. And I tried to continue speaking for one minute about something theme.
I sometimes couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my words, however, I almost could continue speaking. It was prepared theme in advance, not free theme, though. My teacher, Cathay said that I prepared every lessons in advance and it was good, but I prepared too much, though. She meant that I only studied a few situations that the book described.</description>

I mostly made it, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly, though.
I&amp;rsquo;ll practice more and more.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I practiced to continue speaking for one minute. In addition, I practiced to use some common phrasal verbs and various conjunctions. It was difficult to build my opinion, and use phrasal verbs and various conjunctions at the same time. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any words and use those phrasal verbs and conjunctions very much.
On the other hand, the phrasal verbs and various conjunctions like those are important to casual conversation.</description>

In addition, I learned elope and burn bridge. &amp;ldquo;Elope&amp;rdquo; means to leave from your home to get married even though your parents don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to do that. And &amp;ldquo;burn bridge&amp;rdquo; means that you can&amp;rsquo;t get back once you&amp;rsquo;ve done that.
I tried to speak for one minute about anything, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

Again I tried to get off the phone, I didn&amp;rsquo;t do well though. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t end the conversation smoothly and naturally.
I finished Unit 4 to 6 at last, so next lesson, I&amp;rsquo;m going to begin Unit 7 about relationships. I&amp;rsquo;m little worried whether I can do well, because I&amp;rsquo;m introverted.</description>

      <description>At yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned to build sentences using common collocations with do, make, and etc. In addition, I reviewed unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively. I used too many times &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; as conjunctions, though. I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.
At last I&amp;rsquo;ll be transferred to new department. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.</description>

And I learned the meanings of &amp;ldquo;on the good side&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;undecided&amp;rdquo;. And &amp;ldquo;make a difference&amp;rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &amp;ldquo;make a &amp;lsquo;some adjective&amp;rsquo; impression&amp;rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.</description>

It was difficult to organize thoughts first before delivering. I felt I had to respond quickly, on the contrary I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my words. Or I found only meaning less words.

At the previous lesson, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep discussing about a community event. This time I did. I was relieved to be able to do that. I was a bit nervous before the last lesson. But I did and I got a bit confidence about English conversation.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s English lesson, I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event. I tried that, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do well at all. I think, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time. I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English. So, I can&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly in English about a theme which I&amp;rsquo;ve never think about. I&amp;rsquo;ve read books about how to study English before.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson.
I learned about the difference between assertive and aggressive. Assertive means that you are confident and say clearly what you think or what you want without attacking someone. It&amp;rsquo;s polite and positive. Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly, but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.
And, I learned about phone conversation. When you call someone, first, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc. Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&amp;rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&amp;rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.</description>

      <description>In yesterday English lesson, I had my teacher check my blog again and reviewed Unit-4, and then finished it. And I started to learn Unit-5 and found that my teacher eats crisps too much.
I learned the following vocabularies.
 philanthropist  I told my teacher about my uncle who is keen on volunteering and then my teacher called him a philanthropist.   divorce and annulment  I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the word annulment, and so I can&amp;rsquo;t understand the difference between divorce and annulment.</description>
