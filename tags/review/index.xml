      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s English lesson, I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event. I tried that, however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do well at all. I think, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time. I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English. So, I can&amp;rsquo;t respond quickly in English about a theme which I&amp;rsquo;ve never think about. I&amp;rsquo;ve read books about how to study English before.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson.
I learned about the difference between assertive and aggressive. Assertive means that you are confident and say clearly what you think or what you want without attacking someone. It&amp;rsquo;s polite and positive. Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly, but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.
And, I learned about phone conversation. When you call someone, first, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc. Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.</description>

      <description>At the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&amp;rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&amp;rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.</description>

      <description>In yesterday English lesson, I had my teacher check my blog again and reviewed Unit-4, and then finished it. And I started to learn Unit-5 and found that my teacher eats crisps too much.
I learned the following vocabularies.
 philanthropist  I told my teacher about my uncle who is keen on volunteering and then my teacher called him a philanthropist.  divorce and annulment  I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the word annulment, and so I can&amp;rsquo;t understand the difference between divorce and annulment.</description>
