      <description>&amp;ldquo;How to build your confidence - and spark it others&amp;rdquo; I lose my confidence when I fail and disappointed myself,
when I was given cold stares, when I was blamed, and
when I was ignored.
This TED talk, Ms. Brittany Packnett&#39;s speech, gives me a confidence.
It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.
 Impressed words  Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it.</description>
