      <description>Today I came back to my parent&amp;rsquo;s home. Because my brother who lives in America was going back to my parent&amp;rsquo;s home. We had happy family reunion on Father&amp;rsquo;s day.
But there was also sad news. My brother&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rsquo;s father had stomach cancer and colon cancer. He had surgery to remove his cancer, and had been in the hospital for a month. It was last December. He didn&amp;rsquo;t inform his daughter that he had surgery so as not to make her worry.</description>
