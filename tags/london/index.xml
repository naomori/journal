      <description>Today, we went to Buckingham Palace to see changing of the guard. I&#39;ve seen that before on TV. There was crowded so much. A lot of tourists came to see that like us. We saw changing the guard, they were like toy soldiers. After that, we went to British Museum to see Rosetta Stone. I was very impressed because it was the key to solving the mysteries of ancient Egypt. </description>

      <description>English Breakfast I ate English breakfast in England for the first time. It was lovely delicious.
Afternoon tea At last I had an afternoon tea in England. The tea is lovely tasty, and scones with plenty of clotted cream too. I enjoyed the afternoon tea.

      <description>Take a walk in London We had a little bit jet lag, so we were going to relax and take a walk in London. And we&#39;d like to buy gifts in return.
London is a huge and advanced city, however, London has buildings from the Middle Ages. It&#39;s an amazing and attractive city.
Shopping We haven&#39;t decided what to buy as gifts yet, so we were going to go window-shopping at Soho and Regent Street.</description>

      <description>Immigration I got a little bit nervous at immigration, because I usually get asked many questions at the immigration examination and I can&#39;t answer well.
This time, however, immigration officers are very kind. Moreover, my wife said &amp;ldquo;This is our honeymoon&amp;rdquo; then, they said to us &amp;ldquo;Conguraturations!&amp;rdquo; with smile.
Tube We went to the center of London city by Tube: it&#39;s subway in London. To ride Tube, we bought Oyster card at the station.</description>
