      Today, I went to Osaka to get a lecture of AI.
I always buy the following this.
It's the most famous steamed bun with meat filling in Japan, especially in Kansai region. I stayed in the line for about twenty minutes to buy it.
And then, I ate the following this because I had enough time before the departure of the Shinkansen.
It's also famous ramen in Kansai region. The last time I ate it was when I was a graduate student, about 15 years ago.

That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn't concentrate.
In these day, I'm thinking of buying a bigger bed that is comfortable to sleep.

This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.

Keynote (10:00-11:30) It was the almost same as the Day 1's keynote. Furthermore, the presenter talked too much and it was overtime. Panasonic's speech wasn't good neither.

      AWS DeepRace League - Technical Workdshop Yesterday, I joined the &ldquo;AWS Deep Racer League - Technical Workhop&rdquo;, because I wanted to have fun learning about machine learning. The AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer's Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.

      This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn't feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.

      I worked from home today. Working from home is a lot easier as I don't have to commute. Because it takes 1 hour and half to commute.
And more, there is no toilet problem. In Office, after lunch, almost toilets are always full. Reforming working style should be started from the toilet.
 And I'm gonna have a English lesson this evening. The following is today's homework.

And I'll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I'll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.

Afternoon tea At last I had an afternoon tea in England. The tea is lovely tasty, and scones with plenty of clotted cream too. I enjoyed the afternoon tea.

      Take a walk in London We had a little bit jet lag, so we were going to relax and take a walk in London. And we'd like to buy gifts in return.
London is a huge and advanced city, however, London has buildings from the Middle Ages. It's an amazing and attractive city.
Shopping We haven't decided what to buy as gifts yet, so we were going to go window-shopping at Soho and Regent Street.

This time, however, immigration officers are very kind. Moreover, my wife said &ldquo;This is our honeymoon&rdquo; then, they said to us &ldquo;Conguraturations!&rdquo; with smile.

      This weekend was relaxing days. I went to the city library and borrowed a book, the title is &ldquo;Talking to My Daughter About the Economy.&quot;. I didn't read it yet.
After that I went to shopping at near super market and bought lots of food and drink. Because I had a trip to Aomori two weekends ago, so that I couldn't go to shopping.
In addition, I run at the seaside for about 1 hour, 10 kilo meters.

      I and my wife enjoyed a 3-days trip in Aomori last weekend. We traveled by train. I have never taken the Tohoku shinkansen until this time. I was looking forward to a train lunch box in the Tohoku shinkansen. Unfortunately, it wasn't sold in the train. I don't why it wasn't, however, I was disappointed with that. Probably, Tokyo lunch box isn't popular very much.
Day 1, after four and half hours train, we arrived in Aomori at 1:00 pm.

I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively. I used too many times &ldquo;and&rdquo; as conjunctions, though. I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.
At last I'll be transferred to new department. I'm gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don't have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.

      Today is my wife's birthday. I presented fluffy pajamas, champagne and a champagne glass to her. She was very pleased and I was glad to see that. The fluffy pajamas was Gelato pique's one that she's been wanted before. Champagne was Veuve Clicquot that is the one of her favorite. And the champagne glass was Riedel's one. Riedel's glass makes a difference in taste of wine.
Even if you aren't a wine expert, you can feel the difference between normal glass and Riedel's one.

Answer You can't remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don't have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.

      Today is a relaxing day.
I woke up at 10:00 o'clock on a late morning than usual. And then, I sent the packages which at the post office.
I had Taiwan ramen of a restaurant called Misen which is famouse in Nagoya for lunch. It was very hot and tasted wonderful.
After lunch, I took a nap for 1 hour. I went to surfing. The waves wasn't very high, but at least it was just right for me.

      At the yesterday's lesson, I reviewed Unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. It's about ways to talk about the future and food. Again I tried to get off the phone, I didn't do well though. I couldn't end the conversation smoothly and naturally.
I finished Unit 4 to 6 at last, so next lesson, I'm going to begin Unit 7 about relationships. I'm little worried whether I can do well, because I'm introverted.

      At yesterday's lesson, I learned to build sentences using common collocations with do, make, and etc. In addition, I reviewed unit 4 to 6 through some exercises. I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively. I used too many times &ldquo;and&rdquo; as conjunctions, though. I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.
At last I'll be transferred to new department. I'm gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don't have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.

      At the last lesson, I answered a question whose the person couldn't have time to listen to recordings of his lectures. My advice was taking notes of his lectures, because it doesn't take time rather than listening to the recordings.
And I learned the meanings of &ldquo;on the good side&rdquo; and &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;. And &ldquo;make a difference&rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &ldquo;make a &lsquo;some adjective&rsquo; impression&rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.

      Today's English lesson, I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event. I tried that, however, I couldn't do well at all. I think, it's difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time. I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English. So, I can't respond quickly in English about a theme which I've never think about. I've read books about how to study English before.

      At the yesterday's lesson.
I learned about the difference between assertive and aggressive. Assertive means that you are confident and say clearly what you think or what you want without attacking someone. It's polite and positive. Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly, but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.
And, I learned about phone conversation. When you call someone, first, you've got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc. Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.

      At the yesterday's lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I've got to learn those.
And I'll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I'll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.

It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.

      Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It's the Softech's soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7'0&rdquo;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.

      &ldquo;How to build your confidence - and spark it others&rdquo; I lose my confidence when I fail and disappointed myself,
when I was given cold stares, when I was blamed, and
when I was ignored.
This TED talk, Ms. Brittany Packnett's speech, gives me a confidence.
It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.
 Impressed words  Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it.

Answer You can't remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don't have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.
