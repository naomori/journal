      Today, I went to Osaka to get a lecture of AI.
I always buy the following this.
It&rsquo;s the most famous steamed bun with meat filling in Japan, especially in Kansai region. I stayed in the line for about twenty minutes to buy it.
And then, I ate the following this because I had enough time before the departure of the Shinkansen.
It&rsquo;s also famous ramen in Kansai region. The last time I ate it was when I was a graduate student, about 15 years ago.

It feels so good to try new things at any age.

That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate.

This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.

Keynote (10:00-11:30) It was the almost same as the Day 1&rsquo;s keynote. Furthermore, the presenter talked too much and it was overtime. Panasonic&rsquo;s speech wasn&rsquo;t good neither.
 [初級] AWS コンテナサービス入門 (12:00-12:40) The presenter talked very well, so I could understand about the AWS Container Services.

The AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.

      This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn&rsquo;t feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.

Donaire was the strongest boxer in bantamweight until Inoue&rsquo;s come. There was no boxer to worth to fight with Donaire in bantamweight, so he gained his weight to featherweight to fight with stronger boxers. But, it was too heavy for him in featherweight. He couldn&rsquo;t bring his true strength.
At last, Donaire fights with Inoue tonight.

And I learned the meanings of &ldquo;on the good side&rdquo; and &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;. And &ldquo;make a difference&rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &ldquo;make a &lsquo;some adjective&rsquo; impression&rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.

      Today I came back to my parent&rsquo;s home. Because my brother who lives in America was going back to my parent&rsquo;s home. We had happy family reunion on Father&rsquo;s day.
But there was also sad news. My brother&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s father had stomach cancer and colon cancer. He had surgery to remove his cancer, and had been in the hospital for a month. It was last December. He didn&rsquo;t inform his daughter that he had surgery so as not to make her worry.

      I and my wife went to Kurumaya in Fujisawa. Kurumaya had a special service for summer only. Yukata and japanese cuisine were included in the set, and the Kimono teacher dressed us in yukata. In addition, a professional photographer took a picture of us.
The meal was very delicious. We will definitely be there next year.

        2020-02-24: What is Zen?
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      At last lesson, my teacher Cathy said that I have to research about Zen and I have to tell her what is Zen and how to do Zen. It&rsquo;s difficult to explain about Zen, I think. Because Zen is one of religions, so it must be complicated and confusing. At first, I searched Zen by Google.
Zen is one of training of Zenshu. Zenshu is one sect of Buddhism, and the goal of Zenshu is to attain spiritual enlightenment.

      Unit-8: What if? Lesson.A: Wishes 1. Getting started A. What would you like more of in your life? I can&rsquo;t speak English smoothly and naturally. So I wish I could speak English well. If I could speak English well, I could enjoy movies, musical, and trip more than before, definitely. Furthermore, if I do that, I&rsquo;d get a interesting job and work happily. And if I win a lottery, I&rsquo;d probably take long vacations to go all around the world.

Because someone who don&rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&rsquo;t like.

        2020-02-28: Review the last lesson
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about dilemmas and some verbs + prepositions. Dilemma means a situation in which it&rsquo;s very difficult to decide what to do, because all the choices seem equally good or equally bad. Longman dictionary says that. I answered questions which have dilemmas.
And today, I worked from home all day. It&rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.

      At today&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about grammar of wishes and imaginary situations or events. And I made some sentences with wishes and imaginary situations. Furthermore, I started lesson B about dilemmas. I made some sentences which have dilemmas, however I couldn&rsquo;t do well. I usually don&rsquo;t feel dilemmas, I live simply every day, I guess.
Anyway, at the next lesson, I&rsquo;m gonna continue to learn about dilemmas. My homework is to make some sentences about my dilemmas.

Zen is one of training of Zenshu. Zenshu is one sect of Buddhism, and the goal of Zenshu is to attain spiritual enlightenment.

Answer You can&rsquo;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&rsquo;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.

Unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t see the sunrise and Mt.Fuji on New Year&rsquo;s Day because of thick cloud. Today we ate Zouni as brunch. My wife cooked Hakata Zouni which is localized in Hakata region. It contains Mochi, Katsuona(a kind of leaf mustard), Buri(a yellowtail fish), and etc. It&rsquo;s really tasty, I like it.

      At today&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about grammar of wishes and imaginary situations or events. And I made some sentences with wishes and imaginary situations. Furthermore, I started lesson B about dilemmas. I made some sentences which have dilemmas, however I couldn&rsquo;t do well. I usually don&rsquo;t feel dilemmas, I live simply every day, I guess.
Anyway, at the next lesson, I&rsquo;m gonna continue to learn about dilemmas. My homework is to make some sentences about my dilemmas.

      At today&rsquo;s lesson, I talked about one of my best friends, how we met, where we became friends and his characteristics using &ldquo;both&rdquo; and &ldquo;neither&rdquo;. Finally, I reviewed this unit through vocabulary notebook, phrasal verbs.
Next lesson, I&rsquo;m going to make some sentences using phrasal verbs, and then I&rsquo;ll start unit 8. So that I have to review those phrasal verbs. My teacher said that you will use phrasal verbs in usual conversation and so it&rsquo;s useful and you should learn phrasal verbs definitely.

      At yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I talked about my first Sapporo trip. My teacher has been to Sapporo, but on September. She envied me for winter Sapporo. Autumn Sapporo is also good, I think. However, amazing snowy landscape in Sapporo was amazing and fantastic.
For my homework, I gave some advice to younger people about online dating and something. Furthermore I talked about getting back in touch with my old friends, and how I met my best friends.

      At the last lesson, I learned to soften comments and make sentences using those phrases. And I tried to continue speaking for one minute about something theme.
I sometimes couldn&rsquo;t find my words, however, I almost could continue speaking. It was prepared theme in advance, not free theme, though. My teacher, Cathay said that I prepared every lessons in advance and it was good, but I prepared too much, though. She meant that I only studied a few situations that the book described.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I practiced to continue speaking for one minute. In addition, I practiced to use some common phrasal verbs and various conjunctions. It was difficult to build my opinion, and use phrasal verbs and various conjunctions at the same time. I couldn&rsquo;t find any words and use those phrasal verbs and conjunctions very much.
On the other hand, the phrasal verbs and various conjunctions like those are important to casual conversation.

      I learned some vocabularies and grammars about dating. And I learned some phrasal verbs like get along, go out, break up and so on.
In addition, I learned elope and burn bridge. &ldquo;Elope&rdquo; means to leave from your home to get married even though your parents don&rsquo;t allow you to do that. And &ldquo;burn bridge&rdquo; means that you can&rsquo;t get back once you&rsquo;ve done that.
I tried to speak for one minute about anything, but I couldn&rsquo;t.

I finished Unit 4 to 6 at last, so next lesson, I&rsquo;m going to begin Unit 7 about relationships. I&rsquo;m little worried whether I can do well, because I&rsquo;m introverted.

At last I&rsquo;ll be transferred to new department. I&rsquo;m gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don&rsquo;t have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.

      At the last lesson, I answered a question whose the person couldn&rsquo;t have time to listen to recordings of his lectures. My advice was taking notes of his lectures, because it doesn&rsquo;t take time rather than listening to the recordings.
And I learned the meanings of &ldquo;on the good side&rdquo; and &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;. And &ldquo;make a difference&rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &ldquo;make a &lsquo;some adjective&rsquo; impression&rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.

Calm down, chill out, take it easy, Naoki. Nobody blame you. You don&rsquo;t have to feel nervous.

I learned about the difference between assertive and aggressive. Assertive means that you are confident and say clearly what you think or what you want without attacking someone. It&rsquo;s polite and positive. Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly, but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.
And, I learned about phone conversation. When you call someone, first, you&rsquo;ve got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc. Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.

And I&rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.

When I was in a network trouble, I&rsquo;ve done multitask. It was calling customer, solving the problems, writing the report, asking my colleague to help me by a chat tool, and explaining that to my boss at the same time.

      This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn&rsquo;t feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.

      I was thinking of surfing today as I did yesterday. So I went to surf. But, I couldn&rsquo;t surf, I was almost drown.
The low pressure made strong onshore winds and high waves, making it difficult for me to surf. They disturbed me trying to go outside.
The wind was weak early in the morning, so I wish I had gone surfing at that time.
In the afternoon, I watched a drama broadcasted on NETFLIX.

This is the surfboard I used. It&rsquo;s the Softech&rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7&rsquo;0&rdquo;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.

And today, I worked from home all day. It&rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.

Because someone who don&rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&rsquo;t like.

        2019-06-29: Going out for drinking in Noge, Yokohama

      Today, I went out for drinking with my wife and friends in Noge, Yokohama. It was drizzling rain, but I&rsquo;m glad it didn&rsquo;t rain heavily.
We went to three Izakaya bars. In Noge, there are many Izakaya bars, so people go to some Izakaya bars to enjoy various dishes and drinks.
One of our friends traveled to Spain for a week in early June. She gave us some presents. We were very happy.

        2019-08-14: Japanese cuisine in yukata

      I and my wife went to Kurumaya in Fujisawa. Kurumaya had a special service for summer only. Yukata and japanese cuisine were included in the set, and the Kimono teacher dressed us in yukata. In addition, a professional photographer took a picture of us.
The meal was very delicious. We will definitely be there next year.

      Today is sunny weather during the rainy season. The air temperature is high and humidity is also high, but at least it&rsquo;s better than a rainy day.
Apart from that, Zozomat was announced. It measures your foot shape three-dimensionally in millimeters.
It&rsquo;s a great innovation because I have had several mistakes in selecting shoes. It will be delivered this winter, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.
