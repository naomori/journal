      Today, I went to Osaka to get a lecture of AI.
I always buy the following this.
It&rsquo;s the most famous steamed bun with meat filling in Japan, especially in Kansai region. I stayed in the line for about twenty minutes to buy it.
And then, I ate the following this because I had enough time before the departure of the Shinkansen.
It&rsquo;s also famous ramen in Kansai region. The last time I ate it was when I was a graduate student, about 15 years ago.

It feels so good to try new things at any age.

That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate.
In these day, I&rsquo;m thinking of buying a bigger bed that is comfortable to sleep.

This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.

Keynote (10:00-11:30) It was the almost same as the Day 1&rsquo;s keynote. Furthermore, the presenter talked too much and it was overtime. Panasonic&rsquo;s speech wasn&rsquo;t good neither.
[初級] AWS コンテナサービス入門 (12:00-12:40) The presenter talked very well, so I could understand about the AWS Container Services.

In this AWS Summit Tokyo 2019, 33,000+ have been registered. AWS has 50% share in cloud business, it&rsquo;s great.

      AWS DeepRace League - Technical Workdshop Yesterday, I joined the &ldquo;AWS Deep Racer League - Technical Workhop&rdquo;, because I wanted to have fun learning about machine learning. The AWS DeepRacer is a 1&frasl;18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.

      I attended AWS Summit Tokyo 2019 today. It will be held in 3 days. I&rsquo;m gonna attend it every days.
Keynote (10:00-11:30) The music was loud at the venue and it was like rock concert, so I was a little excited. The opening of keynote was started with movies and dance. It&rsquo;s completely concert.
In this AWS Summit Tokyo 2019, 33,000+ have been registered. AWS has 50% share in cloud business, it&rsquo;s great.

      Today, I spent a depraved day. I watched anime all day long. It was One punch man.
This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.

Sadly, however, the number of eels has been decreasing. It&rsquo;s said that the reasons are overfishing and environmental change.
Since the ecology of eels isn&rsquo;t known yet, complete eel farming is difficult.
Even now, research on complete eel farming is being continued, and it is said that it may be successful with a little more.

To learn daily conversation, I will watch it twice each time. The first time, I watch it in Japanese with English caption to know what each its quotes mean. The second time, I watch it in English with English caption, so I learn pronunciation and expressions in English.

        2019-07-01: Running along the Kugenuma coast

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I have been running along the Kugenuma coast. That was the first time in a month. It was very humid and hot, but it was nice to run along the seafront at night.
On the sandy beach, the construction of a sea house was being promoted at night, and I felt the arrival of summer.

      I had trouble falling asleep last night. Because It was hot and humid night.
I heard that the function of the brain is blunted like drunken if you don&rsquo;t have enough sleep.
That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate.
In these day, I&rsquo;m thinking of buying a bigger bed that is comfortable to sleep.

        2019-06-30: Strong onshore wind and High waves
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I was thinking of surfing today as I did yesterday. So I went to surf. But, I couldn&rsquo;t surf, I was almost drown.
The low pressure made strong onshore winds and high waves, making it difficult for me to surf. They disturbed me trying to go outside.
The wind was weak early in the morning, so I wish I had gone surfing at that time.
In the afternoon, I watched a drama broadcasted on NETFLIX.

I woke up at 10:00 o&rsquo;clock on a late morning than usual. And then, I sent the packages which at the post office.
I had Taiwan ramen of a restaurant called Misen which is famouse in Nagoya for lunch. It was very hot and tasted wonderful.
After lunch, I took a nap for 1 hour. I went to surfing. The waves wasn&rsquo;t very high, but at least it was just right for me.

I rode waves only a few times, and wiped out many times. The sea is fairly cold that I might caught a bit cold. Still, I enjoyed surfing very much and I will keep surfing.

      Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It&rsquo;s the Softech&rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7&rsquo;0&rdquo;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.

when I was ignored.
This TED talk, Ms. Brittany Packnett&rsquo;s speech, gives me a confidence.
It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.
Impressed words  Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it.
