      Today, I went to Osaka to get a lecture of AI.
I always buy the following this.
It&rsquo;s the most famous steamed bun with meat filling in Japan, especially in Kansai region. I stayed in the line for about twenty minutes to buy it.
And then, I ate the following this because I had enough time before the departure of the Shinkansen.
It&rsquo;s also famous ramen in Kansai region. The last time I ate it was when I was a graduate student, about 15 years ago.

It feels so good to try new things at any age.

That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate.

This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.

Keynote (10:00-11:30) It was the almost same as the Day 1&rsquo;s keynote. Furthermore, the presenter talked too much and it was overtime. Panasonic&rsquo;s speech wasn&rsquo;t good neither.
 [初級] AWS コンテナサービス入門 (12:00-12:40) The presenter talked very well, so I could understand about the AWS Container Services.

The AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.

      This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn&rsquo;t feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.

Even if I belong to any companies or any communities in the future, I must be having at least one rude person, I think.
The book said that if you met rude person in your office, you should care about only yourself and your future.

And I learned the meanings of &ldquo;on the good side&rdquo; and &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;. And &ldquo;make a difference&rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &ldquo;make a &lsquo;some adjective&rsquo; impression&rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.

Sadly, however, the number of eels has been decreasing. It&rsquo;s said that the reasons are overfishing and environmental change.
Since the ecology of eels isn&rsquo;t known yet, complete eel farming is difficult.
Even now, research on complete eel farming is being continued, and it is said that it may be successful with a little more.

So far, or even now Japanese traditional companies valued not only company loyalty but input factors such as time and effort rather than output factors like results or progress.

Zen is one of training of Zenshu. Zenshu is one sect of Buddhism, and the goal of Zenshu is to attain spiritual enlightenment.

Because someone who don&rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&rsquo;t like.

I did it, and my score is 6,370 words. It can be enough to make a small talk in ordinary life, however I can&rsquo;t. Because it&rsquo;s just a number of words I can read, not speak. I should get more words I can use in having conversations.

      I&rsquo;ve been learning English at English school for about a year. I want to improve my English more, however I sometimes can&rsquo;t listen to what my teacher said, and even if I can, I can&rsquo;t respond quickly.
In these days, I&rsquo;ve been reading some news and summarizing it. And I give a short speech about it in my class. Although, I can&rsquo;t remember all of the speech, so I can&rsquo;t give a speech well, I read it.

      In the morning, I went surfing for the first time in a while. Because I bought a bodyboard and wanted to try it. Fortunately, there were good waves to surf. Unfortunately, I lost my right foot swim-fin. When I tried to ride a big wave and I caught it, however, on the contrary the wave caught me and swallowed me. I was swallowed, upside down, round and round. When I floated to the surface of the sea, I realized that my right swim-fin had gone.

Furthermore, I learned about &lsquo;neat&rsquo; and &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;. You can use &ldquo;that would be neat&rdquo;, when you listen to someone who talked you about reasonable and simple idea to solve a problem. And you can use &ldquo;why not?

Yesterday, I went jogging for an hour at the seaside, and I walked for two hours to play game, Dragon Quest walk, kind of Pokemon go. I was too tired so I couldn&rsquo;t have enough sleep.

      This weekend was relaxing days. I went to the city library and borrowed a book, the title is &ldquo;Talking to My Daughter About the Economy.&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t read it yet.
After that I went to shopping at near super market and bought lots of food and drink. Because I had a trip to Aomori two weekends ago, so that I couldn&rsquo;t go to shopping.
In addition, I run at the seaside for about 1 hour, 10 kilo meters.

      I and my wife enjoyed a 3-days trip in Aomori last weekend. We traveled by train. I have never taken the Tohoku shinkansen until this time. I was looking forward to a train lunch box in the Tohoku shinkansen. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t sold in the train. I don&rsquo;t why it wasn&rsquo;t, however, I was disappointed with that. Probably, Tokyo lunch box isn&rsquo;t popular very much.
Day 1, after four and half hours train, we arrived in Aomori at 1:00 pm.

At last I&rsquo;ll be transferred to new department. I&rsquo;m gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don&rsquo;t have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.

      Today is my wife&rsquo;s birthday. I presented fluffy pajamas, champagne and a champagne glass to her. She was very pleased and I was glad to see that. The fluffy pajamas was Gelato pique&rsquo;s one that she&rsquo;s been wanted before. Champagne was Veuve Clicquot that is the one of her favorite. And the champagne glass was Riedel&rsquo;s one. Riedel&rsquo;s glass makes a difference in taste of wine.
Even if you aren&rsquo;t a wine expert, you can feel the difference between normal glass and Riedel&rsquo;s one.

Answer You can&rsquo;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&rsquo;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.

      Due to COVID-19, every countries&rsquo; government have started lockdown. On the other hand, Japan government hasn&rsquo;t started lockdown. Why?
The reason is that Japanese constitution don&rsquo;t have the Act, like Emergency Powers Act in U.K or National Emergency Act in U.S.A. So, Japan rockdown can&rsquo;t be done. The Act has power to restrict private rights for moving, shopping, business activities, like that. It&rsquo;s useful for helping people under severe situations like terrible earthquakes, hurricanes or disease like this COVID-19.

I&rsquo;ve got to make up my mind what I should do in the Cloud development team. I&rsquo;m thinking about building the development and operating environment of Machine-Learning with AWS and Jetson Nano.

Who&rsquo;s going to do what? 1. When is the event going to be? Where? What time? We&rsquo;d better hold the event during summer vacation. Because adults can take day-off easily.
We might want to hold the event from 5pm to 8pm. Because children had better sleep early, not staying up late at night.

1. Why did Japanese government decide to lift emergency declaration for corona virus? Japanese government might keep lifting emergency declaration unless hospital beds run out. We all know that pandemic can&rsquo;t be calm down soon and it must be keeping out-break until at least two years later, because we don&rsquo;t have any vaccine and medicine for corona virus now, and we might not have it until next year in the shortest.

I have to live a regular life and keep studying during holidays. I&rsquo;ll do it. I said it yesterday as well, though.

      At the last lesson, I studied vocabulary notebook about on and off. I reviewed phrasal verbs and made some sentences using phrasal verbs.
From tomorrow, my holidays are gonna start. However, unfortunately I can&rsquo;t go anywhere due to corona virus. Most shops and restaurants are closed, and the local people might not welcome people who come from other places, because of suppressing infection of corona virus.
Now, very gloomy atmosphere is sweeping over Japan.

      I&rsquo;ll make sentences using vocabularies I&rsquo;ve learned at the last lesson, privately, publicly, scam, cheating, trick, &lsquo;when it comes to&hellip;&rsquo;, and hold onto.
Outbreak of Corona virus in Japan is less terrible than other countries, the one of the reasons is that Japanese people don&rsquo;t hug, shake hands, and cheek kiss privately. In addition, another reason is that Japanese people wear a mask and don&rsquo;t speak much in the train, buses, and elevators publicly.

      Also today, I worked from home. I did some stretching exercises this morning and yesterday&rsquo;s morning after waking up. Then, I can get through the day comfortably. I&rsquo;ll continue to do stretching after waking up.
I had an English lesson yesterday. It was a remote lesson via zoom, video call. I&rsquo;ve gotten used to have a remote lesson, I think. However I&rsquo;ll have a offline lesson if I can. There is a good point on a offline lesson, that is I can see a teacher&rsquo;s mouth behavior and hear clear pronunciation.

I could respond some questions quickly rather than before, relatively. I used too many times &ldquo;and&rdquo; as conjunctions, though. I will use vary conjunctions next lesson.
At last I&rsquo;ll be transferred to new department. I&rsquo;m gonna work in the Cloud development team. I don&rsquo;t have to move a office, just 5 meters move in the same office.

      At the last lesson, I answered a question whose the person couldn&rsquo;t have time to listen to recordings of his lectures. My advice was taking notes of his lectures, because it doesn&rsquo;t take time rather than listening to the recordings.
And I learned the meanings of &ldquo;on the good side&rdquo; and &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;. And &ldquo;make a difference&rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &ldquo;make a &lsquo;some adjective&rsquo; impression&rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I practiced delivering my experience and making a question. I couldn&rsquo;t respond quickly, and I took time to deliver my experience. It was difficult to organize thoughts first before delivering. I felt I had to respond quickly, on the contrary I couldn&rsquo;t find my words. Or I found only meaning less words.
Calm down, chill out, take it easy, Naoki. Nobody blame you. You don&rsquo;t have to feel nervous.

      Today&rsquo;s English lesson, I practiced phone conversation, and meeting conversation about a community event. I tried that, however, I couldn&rsquo;t do well at all. I think, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to build my opinion and explain it in English at the same time. I do think in Japanese, and translate it into English. So, I can&rsquo;t respond quickly in English about a theme which I&rsquo;ve never think about. I&rsquo;ve read books about how to study English before.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson.
I learned about the difference between assertive and aggressive. Assertive means that you are confident and say clearly what you think or what you want without attacking someone. It&rsquo;s polite and positive. Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly, but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.
And, I learned about phone conversation. When you call someone, first, you&rsquo;ve got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc. Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about reduction of verbs. Native speakers usually use reduction verbs, so that I&rsquo;ve got to learn those.
And I&rsquo;ll try to categorize vocabularies into each situations, because I can find proper words which express my feeling and thinking. If you categorize vocabularies into each situations in advance, you can find and choose your word easily.
At first I&rsquo;ll categorized vocabularies into 6 situations like common vocabulary, people, private life, public life, environment and nature.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about dilemmas and some verbs + prepositions. Dilemma means a situation in which it&rsquo;s very difficult to decide what to do, because all the choices seem equally good or equally bad. Longman dictionary says that. I answered questions which have dilemmas.
And today, I worked from home all day. It&rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.

      At today&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about grammar of wishes and imaginary situations or events. And I made some sentences with wishes and imaginary situations. Furthermore, I started lesson B about dilemmas. I made some sentences which have dilemmas, however I couldn&rsquo;t do well. I usually don&rsquo;t feel dilemmas, I live simply every day, I guess.
Anyway, at the next lesson, I&rsquo;m gonna continue to learn about dilemmas. My homework is to make some sentences about my dilemmas.

Because someone who don&rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&rsquo;t like.

When I was in a network trouble, I&rsquo;ve done multitask. It was calling customer, solving the problems, writing the report, asking my colleague to help me by a chat tool, and explaining that to my boss at the same time.

      I went to Sapporo last weekend. It was the first time to visit Sapporo for me. I enjoyed a snowy landscape, Snow festival, and food and drink, of course. It was an amazing trip totally.
When I arrived at Chitose airport, it was not much cold. I felt it was the same temperature as Kanagawa. It was negative two degrees in Sapporo and positive two degrees in Kanagawa, actually. It was just a little bit difference.

 Japan&rsquo;s formula for life satisfaction  Ikigai means what it’s something you live for.
So far, or even now Japanese traditional companies valued not only company loyalty but input factors such as time and effort rather than output factors like results or progress. Long hours and sacrificed leisure time were (and still are) seen as positive virtues, while the “ganbaru” trait – meaning “trying hard” – is valued above all.
