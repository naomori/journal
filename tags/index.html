      Today, I went to Osaka to get a lecture of AI.
I always buy the following this.
It&rsquo;s the most famous steamed bun with meat filling in Japan, especially in Kansai region. I stayed in the line for about twenty minutes to buy it.
And then, I ate the following this because I had enough time before the departure of the Shinkansen.
It&rsquo;s also famous ramen in Kansai region. The last time I ate it was when I was a graduate student, about 15 years ago.

It feels so good to try new things at any age.

That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate.

This is an animation in which a hero plays an active role, but what is different from normal animation is that the main hero of this animation is troubled because he is too strong. He is too strong so that he beats any enemy with a single punch. He has lost the purpose of life.

Keynote (10:00-11:30) It was the almost same as the Day 1&rsquo;s keynote. Furthermore, the presenter talked too much and it was overtime. HOGE&rsquo;s speech wasn&rsquo;t good neither.
 [初級] AWS コンテナサービス入門 (12:00-12:40) The presenter talked very well, so I could understand about the AWS Container Services.

The AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.

        2019-11-10: A birthday present
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn&rsquo;t feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.

      I&rsquo;ve finished a book, &ldquo;MASTERING CIVILITY&rdquo;. The reason that I wanted to read this book is that I expected it helps me in life. Because I always have at least one rude friend or colleague, so I want to deal with it well.
Even if I belong to any companies or any communities in the future, I must be having at least one rude person, I think.
The book said that if you met rude person in your office, you should care about only yourself and your future.

And I learned the meanings of &ldquo;on the good side&rdquo; and &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;. And &ldquo;make a difference&rdquo; has positive meanings, not negative. And you can use &ldquo;make a &lsquo;some adjective&rsquo; impression&rdquo;, for example good, bad, intense, etc.

Sadly, however, the number of eels has been decreasing. It&rsquo;s said that the reasons are overfishing and environmental change.
Since the ecology of eels isn&rsquo;t known yet, complete eel farming is difficult.
Even now, research on complete eel farming is being continued, and it is said that it may be successful with a little more.

So, they celebrate for Christmas and Halloween, and they visit the temple of Buddhism where their ancestors were berried, they hold a wedding at the Shinto shrine where they usually worship. For some people who are monotheists, it looks that Japanese people are atheists, I guess. In my case, I believe many Gods who inhabit everything, even flowers, stones, mountains, animals, and so on.

First of all, money can buy time that you can use freely. In general, we sell our time to earn money. If you have enough money, you don&rsquo;t have to do that.

Vocabulary Even if I won the lottery and get huge prize money like approximately a billion dollars. I will not show off with buying a mansion house. Because it can bring some risks like robbery, kidnapping, or threats. I will opt to travel around the world instead. It would be conservative and prudent idea, I think. Because you can have some risks like a dispute, riots, discrimination wherever you live.

Vocabulary I don&rsquo;t think that I can receive some pension when I will be old.

Every year, about 1,000 new words are added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Where do they come from, and how do they make it into our everyday lives?
With over 170,000 words currently in use in the English language, it might seem we already have plenty. Yet, as our world changes, new ideas and inventions spring forth, and science progresses, our existing words leave gaps in what we want to express and we fill those gaps in several ingenious, practical, and occasionally peculiar ways.

Summary According to the speaker, she volunteered to be deliberately infected with COVID-19. Many volunteers like her want to participate in the challenge. Because they thought it&rsquo;s so crucial that the challenge can help researchers to find an effective vaccine. It can work faster and require less volunteers than usual ways. Moreover, it can help politicians design policies that limit COVID-19 transmission and it can give people more working COVID-19 vaccines faster.

Leading people means that you have a clear vision of a world that does not exist, a world that could exist, and by articulating the cause of the vision and the purpose over and over again. It inspires people who believe what you believe, who want to see that world built to join to go with you to figure out ways.

I think that&rsquo;s because many of her students chose an online plan. The students who chose the online plan can book only one class. Therefore, they can&rsquo;t book her another class before they finish her class. Accordingly, it&rsquo;s tough to book for her students to book her class on the day which they want to book, I think.

Notes There are three points to be improved in this class. First, I ought to speak further. For instance, I should expand my opinion adding reason, examples, or feeling. Second, I&rsquo;d better less thinking time. Because it&rsquo;s necessary to respond quickly in general conversation. Finally, I might want to deliver a topic of small talk spontaneously. I should enjoy a conversation positively, not be always a passive attitude in it.

Have you ever been stuck in a traffic? Yes, I have. I&rsquo;ve been stuck in a traffic during consecutive holidays. Because there are several consecutive holidays in Japan. As the result, many Japanese go on a trip at the same time. Once you were caught in a traffic jam, you can&rsquo;t pick up the speed and you have to inch along even if you were in a hurry.

      Writing: Scientists say they can reverse ageing process - 25th November, 2020 Scientists in Israel say they have conducted tests to successfully stop and reverse the biological ageing process. The tests were part of a joint project by Tel Aviv University and the Shamir Medical Center. The researchers said the science behind their experiments was very simple - they used only oxygen to slow down and turn around what happens to cells as they age.

      Review 11/24 lesson Homework: make sentences using at least 4 phrasal verbs about cleaning When I was a child, I was not good at clearing up my room. Contrarily, my mother is neat and tidy, so she couldn&rsquo;t stand my dirty room. Thus, she often told me to tidy up my room and sweep it up at least once a week. Now I am better organized than before. I always hang up my jacket when I come back, so my clothes are never jumbled up on the floor or the bed.

      Review 11/20 lesson: Discussion culture If you were to create a Christmas tradition in Japan, what would you make? I would make a Christmas tradition that the family gather and eat Nabe. Nabe is a stew and soup served in winter, and the dish is frequently cooked at the table. The diners can pick the cooked ingredients they want from the pot. The family can spend wonderful time through Nabe. On the other hand, nowadays many Japanese eat KFC&rsquo;s chicken.

      Writing: Part2 (63, 65, 66) What is your opinion about banning smoking in public?  I agree with banning smoking in public. Because smoking gives both smokers and non-smokers bad effects. For instance, smoke brings a cancer even if non-smokers breath cigarette smoke. Therefore, smokers must smoke in a smoking room, not in public.   Do you think your workplace is woman-friendly?

Researchers from the University of Queensland in Australia conducted a study of fishing around the world. They discovered that fishing nets caught 92 endangered species of seafood and 11 species of marine life classed as &ldquo;critically endangered&rdquo;.

The High Court decided it was wrong to send the Somalis back just because of their nationality. A judge said: &ldquo;The government&rsquo;s decision specifically targeting Somali refugees is an act of group persecution.

      Review 09/18 Lesson They are what I couldn&rsquo;t say what I wanted to say.
Why did the current prime minister of Japan quit? It&rsquo;s because he has a health problem and it has been worse, so he decided not to keep his post. He has been the prime minister before at once, it was fourteen years ago. He resigned from his post at that time because of his health problem. That is to say, he resigned twice from the prime minister.

A cyber-brain can improve the Human-Machine interface amazingly, it can allow people to access machines and data super easily like thinking. The current human-Machine interface devices, like a keyboard, a mouse, a touch pad and screen, or voice commands, are really not kind to people.

      Tonight, the most interesting boxing fight will be held in Japan. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Monster versus The Filipino Flash&rdquo;.
Donaire was the strongest boxer in bantamweight until Inoue&rsquo;s come. There was no boxer to worth to fight with Donaire in bantamweight, so he gained his weight to featherweight to fight with stronger boxers. But, it was too heavy for him in featherweight.

At last, Donaire fights with Inoue tonight.

      Today I came back to my parent&rsquo;s home. Because my brother who lives in America was going back to my parent&rsquo;s home. We had happy family reunion on Father&rsquo;s day.
But there was also sad news. My brother&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s father had stomach cancer and colon cancer. He had surgery to remove his cancer, and had been in the hospital for a month. It was last December. He didn&rsquo;t inform his daughter that he had surgery so as not to make her worry.

Because someone who don&rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&rsquo;t like.

      I hurt my right wrist last week. It&rsquo;s because of too much typing keyboard and mouse click, I guess. So, I went to a doctor to have my right wrist seen. I had my arm taken a x-ray picture then. The doctor said that one of my arm bone is little longer than ordinary. That is, when I move my wrist right and left, the bone tend to push the cartilage.

Although, I have another problem about a storage to hold a dataset for training the model. The problem is that Google Colaboratory can&rsquo;t have much storage, therefore I want to use Amazon S3 and tried it, but it&rsquo;s too slow to read.

On the other hand, I little worried about that it&rsquo;s little bit more difficult to ride surfboard with single fin.

      Today, my new laptop was arrived. It&rsquo;s new xps13 which has a 13.4 inches display and Ice-Lake chip and it&rsquo;s superior to my laptop which I bought three and half years ago. I have felt little bit irritated about bad performance of my laptop, so I ordered it April 14th.
At first, I don&rsquo;t think I can receive it today because DELL told me it will be arribed May 18th. I think it&rsquo;s super late, though.

      Unit-9: Tech savvy? Lesson.D: Identity theft Most People know how to stay safe in the city: Don&rsquo;t walk alone after dark, hold onto your bag on crowded subways, and only ride in registered cabs. However, many people are not so savvy when it comes to staying safe on the Internet and don&rsquo;t know what to look for. Identity theft - when thieves steal your personal information and use your identity to open bank or credit card accounts or take out home loans in your name -is on the rise.

      Also today, I worked from home. I did some stretching exercises this morning and yesterday&rsquo;s morning after waking up. Then, I can get through the day comfortably. I&rsquo;ll continue to do stretching after waking up.
I had an English lesson yesterday. It was a remote lesson via zoom, video call. I&rsquo;ve gotten used to have a remote lesson, I think. However I&rsquo;ll have a offline lesson if I can. There is a good point on a offline lesson, that is I can see a teacher&rsquo;s mouth behavior and hear clear pronunciation.

Unfortunately, I lost my right foot swim-fin. When I tried to ride a big wave and I caught it, however, on the contrary the wave caught me and swallowed me. I was swallowed, upside down, round and round. When I floated to the surface of the sea, I realized that my right swim-fin had gone.

      At the last lesson, I and my teacher cleared my goals of learning English in Cebu.
My goals are, firstly, to speak general English smoothly, frequently, and naturally. Because I want to enjoy small talks with people who I meet in trip. If I could do that, I could have new idea and thought to enjoy my life through their culture, history, custom, and etc.
Secondary is to get a job abroad, like the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, or New Zealand, and so on.

I answered questions which have dilemmas.
And today, I worked from home all day. It&rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.

Because someone who don&rsquo;t know each other may not be able to have a nice chat at the first date. The person don&rsquo;t know what the another person like and don&rsquo;t like, so that sometimes the person do something what the another person don&rsquo;t like.

I was looking forward to a train lunch box in the Tohoku shinkansen. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t sold in the train. I don&rsquo;t why it wasn&rsquo;t, however, I was disappointed with that. Probably, Tokyo lunch box isn&rsquo;t popular very much.
Day 1, after four and half hours train, we arrived in Aomori at 1:00 pm.

The fluffy pajamas was Gelato pique&rsquo;s one that she&rsquo;s been wanted before. Champagne was Veuve Clicquot that is the one of her favorite. And the champagne glass was Riedel&rsquo;s one. Riedel&rsquo;s glass makes a difference in taste of wine.
Even if you aren&rsquo;t a wine expert, you can feel the difference between normal glass and Riedel&rsquo;s one.

Answer You can&rsquo;t remember what you learned, unless you review your lectures. So, you ought to find time to review your lectures, however, you don&rsquo;t have to watch the recordings - provided that you remember the key points of your lectures.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Due to COVID-19, every countries' government have started lockdown. On the other hand, Japan government hasn&rsquo;t started lockdown. Why?
The reason is that Japanese constitution don&rsquo;t have the Act, like Emergency Powers Act in U.K or National Emergency Act in U.S.A. So, Japan rockdown can&rsquo;t be done. The Act has power to restrict private rights for moving, shopping, business activities, like that. It&rsquo;s useful for helping people under severe situations like terrible earthquakes, hurricanes or disease like this COVID-19.

1. Why did Japanese government decide to lift emergency declaration for corona virus? Japanese government might keep lifting emergency declaration unless hospital beds run out. We all know that pandemic can&rsquo;t be calm down soon and it must be keeping out-break until at least two years later, because we don&rsquo;t have any vaccine and medicine for corona virus now, and we might not have it until next year in the shortest.

      I watched a film, &ldquo;Annihilation&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a science fiction horror film. It was released theatricaly in 2018, but it became a box office bomb. And then it was released digitally by Netflix. You can watch it now on Netflix.

Outbreak of Corona virus in Japan is less terrible than other countries, the one of the reasons is that Japanese people don&rsquo;t hug, shake hands, and cheek kiss privately. In addition, another reason is that Japanese people wear a mask and don&rsquo;t speak much in the train, buses, and elevators publicly.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about dilemmas and some verbs + prepositions. Dilemma means a situation in which it&rsquo;s very difficult to decide what to do, because all the choices seem equally good or equally bad. Longman dictionary says that. I answered questions which have dilemmas.
And today, I worked from home all day. It&rsquo;s due to avoid infecting with corona virus. My company told all employees not to work at the office as possible as they can.

      At today&rsquo;s lesson, I learned about grammar of wishes and imaginary situations or events. And I made some sentences with wishes and imaginary situations. Furthermore, I started lesson B about dilemmas. I made some sentences which have dilemmas, however I couldn&rsquo;t do well. I usually don&rsquo;t feel dilemmas, I live simply every day, I guess.
Anyway, at the next lesson, I&rsquo;m gonna continue to learn about dilemmas. My homework is to make some sentences about my dilemmas.

      At today&rsquo;s lesson, I talked about one of my best friends, how we met, where we became friends and his characteristics using &ldquo;both&rdquo; and &ldquo;neither&rdquo;. Finally, I reviewed this unit through vocabulary notebook, phrasal verbs.
Next lesson, I&rsquo;m going to make some sentences using phrasal verbs, and then I&rsquo;ll start unit 8. So that I have to review those phrasal verbs. My teacher said that you will use phrasal verbs in usual conversation and so it&rsquo;s useful and you should learn phrasal verbs definitely.

      At yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I talked about my first Sapporo trip. My teacher has been to Sapporo, but on September. She envied me for winter Sapporo. Autumn Sapporo is also good, I think. However, amazing snowy landscape in Sapporo was amazing and fantastic.
For my homework, I gave some advice to younger people about online dating and something. Furthermore I talked about getting back in touch with my old friends, and how I met my best friends.

      At the last lesson, I learned to soften comments and make sentences using those phrases. And I tried to continue speaking for one minute about something theme.
I sometimes couldn&rsquo;t find my words, however, I almost could continue speaking. It was prepared theme in advance, not free theme, though. My teacher, Cathay said that I prepared every lessons in advance and it was good, but I prepared too much, though. She meant that I only studied a few situations that the book described.

      At the yesterday&rsquo;s lesson, I practiced to continue speaking for one minute. In addition, I practiced to use some common phrasal verbs and various conjunctions. It was difficult to build my opinion, and use phrasal verbs and various conjunctions at the same time. I couldn&rsquo;t find any words and use those phrasal verbs and conjunctions very much.
On the other hand, the phrasal verbs and various conjunctions like those are important to casual conversation.

I finished Unit 4 to 6 at last, so next lesson, I&rsquo;m going to begin Unit 7 about relationships. I&rsquo;m little worried whether I can do well, because I&rsquo;m introverted.

It&rsquo;s polite and positive. Aggressive also means confident and saying clearly, but it has negative meaning like attacking someone.
And, I learned about phone conversation. When you call someone, first, you&rsquo;ve got to say greetings: Hi, Hello, etc. Second, you have to introduce yourself to the person on the phone.

      I had trouble falling asleep last night. Because It was hot and humid night.
I heard that the function of the brain is blunted like drunken if you don&rsquo;t have enough sleep.
That is certainly true. My head was fuzzy and I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate.
In these day, I&rsquo;m thinking of buying a bigger bed that is comfortable to sleep.

      This morning, I went to surfing at Kugenuma Beach. The wave height was thigh to waist. There were good waves. And of course, I wore my new semi-dry wetsuit. It was really comfortable. I didn&rsquo;t feel cold at all, but rather it was a bit hot and sweaty. I was convinced that it would not be cold even in midwinter.
In the afternoon, I went to Minato-mirai in Yokohama to buy a birthday present for my father-in-law.

      I was thinking of surfing today as I did yesterday. So I went to surf. But, I couldn&rsquo;t surf, I was almost drown.
The low pressure made strong onshore winds and high waves, making it difficult for me to surf. They disturbed me trying to go outside.
The wind was weak early in the morning, so I wish I had gone surfing at that time.
In the afternoon, I watched a drama broadcasted on NETFLIX.

      Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It&rsquo;s the Softech&rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7'0&quot;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.

It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.

Where&rsquo;s San Francisco&rsquo;s spirit of tolerance came from I&rsquo;m thinking about characteristics of city culture, reading the article below.
 Where&rsquo;s San Francisco&rsquo;s spirit of tolerance came from  San Francisco has always been known as a city of nonconformity. But in recent decades, already-outlandish San Francisco rents and everyday prices has been inflating and living costs has been pushed to 25% higher than the national average.

      Tonight, the most interesting boxing fight will be held in Japan. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Monster versus The Filipino Flash&rdquo;.
Donaire was the strongest boxer in bantamweight until Inoue&rsquo;s come. There was no boxer to worth to fight with Donaire in bantamweight, so he gained his weight to featherweight to fight with stronger boxers. But, it was too heavy for him in featherweight. He couldn&rsquo;t bring his true strength.
At last, Donaire fights with Inoue tonight.

If I can, I want to work from home everyday.
 By the way, my credit card was used illegally. Actually, I don&rsquo;t have to pay for them. However, I have to reissue my credit card so I cannot use it for a while. In addition, I will need to update the credit card information on my various payments.

The reason why I came to the office is to access the server with GPU in my company. I want to use it to learn Deep Learning. There is no other reason.
Thus, if I don&rsquo;t use it, I don&rsquo;t have to go to the office.

      Typhoon Faxai (Typhoon No.15) came in this morning. It was heavy rain and the wind was blowing hard. All train was stopped until 8 o&rsquo;clock, so I decided to work from home today.

      Today, I went out for drinking with my wife and friends in Noge, Yokohama. It was drizzling rain, but I&rsquo;m glad it didn&rsquo;t rain heavily.
We went to three Izakaya bars. In Noge, there are many Izakaya bars, so people go to some Izakaya bars to enjoy various dishes and drinks.
One of our friends traveled to Spain for a week in early June. She gave us some presents. We were very happy.

      I and my wife went to Kurumaya in Fujisawa. Kurumaya had a special service for summer only. Yukata and japanese cuisine were included in the set, and the Kimono teacher dressed us in yukata. In addition, a professional photographer took a picture of us.
The meal was very delicious. We will definitely be there next year.

      Today is sunny weather during the rainy season. The air temperature is high and humidity is also high, but at least it&rsquo;s better than a rainy day.
Apart from that, Zozomat was announced. It measures your foot shape three-dimensionally in millimeters.
It&rsquo;s a great innovation because I have had several mistakes in selecting shoes. It will be delivered this winter, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.
