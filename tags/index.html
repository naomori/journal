page.5: Lesson-B 3.C Who do you admire ? I admire my brother.
Why ? Because, he works as a engineer in America. I also want to work as a engineer in America or Europe. I envy him working abroad and I&rsquo;m proud of him.

I will study English harder than before so I can work abroad. Of course, I want to enjoy studying English. The proverb says, &ldquo;what one likes, one will do well.

To learn daily conversation, I will watch it twice each time. The first time, I watch it in Japanese with English caption to know what each its quotes mean. The second time, I watch it in English with English caption, so I learn pronunciation and expressions in English.

      I bought this class a year ago, but I haven&rsquo;t been studying python so much recently. I&rsquo;ll try learning python again for improving my programming skill.
This class is very good and reasonable price. I think it fits people who want to study python for the first time. Anyway, it&rsquo;s fun for me to study python. I&rsquo;ll learn python in a fun way from now on.

      AWS DeepRace League - Technical Workdshop Yesterday, I joined the &ldquo;AWS Deep Racer League - Technical Workhop&rdquo;, because I wanted to have fun learning about machine learning. The AWS DeepRacer is a 1&frasl;18 scale racing car and it makes it possible to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a fun way. It was disappointing that the hands-on was disabled due to a failure of the AWS service.
The presenter explained DeepRacer&rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning and its simulator.

      I wanted to surf if the waves were high, but today the waves were too small to surf.
I have jogged along Shonan Coast for the first time in two weeks this evening.
The weather was a bit cloudy, but it was very nice.
I think I have to do exercise, because I have been gaining weight from before, I will continue to jog from now on.

      Today, I surfed in this morning and this evening. The waves size are from shoulder to head, it&rsquo;s high for me. It&rsquo;s hard for me to getting out to out-side.
I rode waves only a few times, and wiped out many times. The sea is fairly cold that I might caught a bit cold. Still, I enjoyed surfing very much and I will keep surfing.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Yesterday, I surfed for the first time in two years. The waves were waist high and very good for me. The water temperature was still a little cold and I needed a wetsuit.
Surfing after a long time was very pleasant and fun, I felt like going to keep surfing from now on.
This is the surfboard I used. It&rsquo;s the Softech&rsquo;s soft-surfboard: SALLY FITZGIBBONS SIGNATURE 7&rsquo;0&rdquo;. This long, buoyant surfboard is good for me because I am not strong and underexercised.

      &ldquo;How to build your confidence - and spark it others&rdquo; I lose my confidence when I fail and disappointed myself,
when I was given cold stares, when I was blamed, and
when I was ignored.
This TED talk, Ms. Brittany Packnett&rsquo;s speech, gives me a confidence.
It tells me that I need not lose my confidence.
Impressed words  Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it.
