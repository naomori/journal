I watched a film, "Annihilation".
It's a science fiction horror film.
It was released theatricaly in 2018, but it became a box office bomb.
And then it was released digitally by Netflix.
You can watch it now on Netflix.

Natalie Portman plays a biologist who entered "The Shimmer",
which is a mysterious quarantined zone of mutating plants and animals caused by an alien presence.
The Shimmer emerged three years prior from a meteor that landed in a lighthouse.
Nobody knows 

Its visuals is mesmerizing and grotesque, and its story is thought-provoking.
